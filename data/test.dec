Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You always been this selfish?
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
You're welcome.
Like you care.
Why?
But you hate Joey
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
You wanna go out with him?
That's what I just said
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
It's off. The whole thing.
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She kissed me.
Away.
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
Forget it.
A deal's a deal.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We don't chat.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
An attempted slit.
William would never have gone to a state school.
Does it matter?
No fear.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Funny, you're the only one
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Who?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Then why'd you ask?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You 're so --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
How?
Fallacy.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Go to the prom with me
No what?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
What?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Is that right?
So what I want doesn't matter?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Just smack her now.
Oh yeah.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
We're your guys.
I'm likin' you guys better
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
I am, Your Eminence
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Yes... I remember...
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Look out of that window.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Chief says -- he has a God.
He understands.
That's what it says.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
What did they say about Granada before today?
A woman?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Thank you.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We don't need to know.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You will regret this.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
He must be replaced.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
What about Oleg?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
So you were never a prostitute?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
In the kitchen.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Vodka tonic.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
When?
A timer.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
It's okay.
No.  I'm okay.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I'm on duty.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You're ruthless.
No.  Are you proposing?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Get down on your knees.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Yes.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Shut up.  Look!
Surprise!  Surprise!
A job?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
You want the tape?  There it is!
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
How long they been livin' here?
Aren't you tired?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Yes?
It's possible.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah, I've been busy.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Jesus.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
You stay with me...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
I didn't have the time.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Hiya, kid.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Shut up.
Sure, right.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's an exception..
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
When is she not in trouble?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
What is?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
Don't exist bud.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Got it...
It's like a cab isn't it?
Where have I heard this song before?
Just one... why me?
What is it?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
I told you not to read all that crap!
...The rain falls...
I want to sleep... forever...
Actually only one cell survived..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Honey, I'm not, please...
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Don't...
Amy...
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
And they are?
Machine.
Where are the women?
Look, I don't know what this...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
We do.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
Eddie.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
I don't know...
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Where?  Show me where.
Don't think I won't.
I'm listening.
That's right.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Three, four years.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Twenty-five.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
My condolences.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
You're joking.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Yes, but...
No.
I don't know.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
We're all like that.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Will you let me look?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who are you?
No... no... no...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Kristen...
It was bad.
I can't find him.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
"In her dream"?
Kristen's story really got to her.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Save it for later.  Come on!
It was Freddy.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
About Freddy?
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Sobering...
Alice...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Then we'll find another way.
That's their problem.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Yeah...
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
He invited me to his house last night.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
But if they <u>do</u>?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
So?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I...don't know!
The frogmen?
Why do you say that?
What????
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Toward the Pole!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
How soon?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Yeah?
Oh.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Yeah.
What blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
It belongs to Pop.
No.
What are you sorry for?
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
Where's the plow?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Yeah. A few things.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where's Jill?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Hi honey.
Mel Gordon.
Yeah.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
But not now.
You knew me as a kid.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
In the living room.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
Crawl!
Wade?
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
What happened?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
That's what you think.
Alice...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Hey, you guys back already?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
You read my mind.
Lemme take a look.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
About goddamn time.
Where are we now?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
One thing I've learned as
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Can't it wait?
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Yes, sir.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I was reading too.
Dunn.
Sir?
Who's that, Ted?
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
That was very well put, Ted.
I mean for Ted.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Roger.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's okay, ROK.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
All right.  Here.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yes.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Well...not for another two hours.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Ted!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
And a little ice.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
The cockpit? What is it?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Show me.
Lay off, asshole.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Did you talk to him?
At the end of the bar.
But I-- .
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
My wife?  She worries about me.
You are married?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
You must leave me alone on this.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Fuck procedure.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Departmental policy.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Hear me out...
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Corporal Hicks!?
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
I don't know.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Alive?
Not that tunnel, the other one!
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
On my way.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Seal the door.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And hope to die?
You're really something, ace.
Did you ever have a baby?
Where is she?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Look!
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Certainly!
His Grace is very angry with you.
Good morning.
No.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
A brothel.
A Turkish brothel.
You might be disappointed.
What?
Don't bother.
What??
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Eat
Of course.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Well, don't do that again!
Tell them to go!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Oh, damn!
Stanzi!
Oh, Stanzi.
No one.
I can't write it!
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
What do you mean?
He needs me, ma'am.
In three months! Papa.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Adorable!
Hey!
Behold!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, indeed.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Twenty-six.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
Am I not welcome?
That's not what I hear.
How many pupils do you have?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Animals?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Well, we can.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
But this is absurd!
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
What exactly are you working on?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh, Excellency, would you?
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
What work?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
The man. He's here.
Finish what?
Of course.
What?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
You go fast!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Exactly.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Mozart -
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
And do they believe it?
You cannot say that!
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Yes?
Yes.
Never mind.
About the ballet.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Who is she?
Yes, sir.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
David?
I beg your pardon?
Call me Alex.
Right.
I dream of death mostly.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you come with me?
Not just a patient -- me.
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Very nice.
There is only one bed.
I was awake and he was in my room.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Jack is dead!
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
What?
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
No!
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Shall we?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
I have no idea.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Walk away, Jack.
No.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David!
What?!
What do you think?
Hello.
How shall I do it?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
No.
I'd like some tea, please.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
Yes - sure—
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yes, sir.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Just pure luck!
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Well, you can. You always could.
Well—
Don't you know?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Got a handkerchief?
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Tomorrow night?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Yes, sir.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
What'll we do?
Is it safe?
Oh, is that so?
Oh, ten dollars—
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yes, why?
Yes, sir.
There you are!
Yes.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
That was two hours ago.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Oh no...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
What's going on?
You're not scared, are you?
Yeah.
Sure, cousin.
That's it.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Get buckets!
The District Marshall
It's a secret.
So?
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I think he's already feeling better.
So we got a plan?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Mm-hmm.
I figure.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Maybe, maybe...
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Ma.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
If I could go back to farming --
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
They're making him a hero now.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Nuh-huh ...
What?
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Pity.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Thank you.
Right here in church?
No.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I think so.
This time we'll make an exception.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Lyla Devereux.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
THEN WHO DID?!
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
Sir?
What, sir?
It is a nice piece of writing.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I demand action.
No.
Vengeance.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Pumpkin?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
What do you want, Courtney?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm just leaving.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
I won't...don't worry.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Lucky, I guess.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
What?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Like what?
New card. What do you think?
Leaving what?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Oh really? That's great.
When?
Yes, sir.
Can you bring Mr...
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Why?
That's...that's too bad.
What?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Does he do this all the time?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
No problem. 
Well...
No, he just hung out there.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
So who was he with?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm not...
What am I gonna do?
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Another Martini, Paul?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
No, Owen.
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
"Make" him?
I can paint anywhere.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Didn't you visit the campus?
Teddy was killed last night.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You can't just walk in, either.
...Why?
Guilt?
What?
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Prick.
He wasn't acting?
Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I am. I am, sir.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
...Do I?
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Cool.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
Where we going?
You're famous around here.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Why's that?
The Day Care?
Hmm?
Certainly not at my happy home.
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Gary.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
What?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Where is he?
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Or sometimes not at all.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Be careful.
We won, Austin.
What?
Yes Basil?
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
I'm sorry?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Sure.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Here, use mine.
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
I am not.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
You know who.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Indeed.
Shut up.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Are you crazy?
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Sure.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Is it one of ours?
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Not me.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
He's asleep.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
... bottle ...
... love...
... love ...
Three days.
Impossible?
Really -- what happened in 1922?
We have met ...
This isn't a game.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
We want to help...!
Too many cooks --
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
And just what is the game?
Mother?
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
Do you really think so?
For a man in my position --
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
An eccentric recluse?
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I thought you didn't.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
But --
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
I shall need a small plane.
How did you guess?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
I feel sure of it.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Walk over to the window ...
You wish.
If you say so.
You are, and it's behind you.
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
When do the girls get to the party?
I'm marrying Debbie.
So does Debbie.
Keep me informed.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Let's get naked.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
I think I screwed that one once.
Why?
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
No sob story is going to change my mind.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
You can tell a man by his friends.
No, Brett, I...
I'm separated.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Very.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
I don't know.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Be gentle.
We're gonna be okay, man...
Stevie... I...
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
Just come down, John. Just --
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Saw what?
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- What are you doing here?
I know.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
How's it going?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Just take it.
Trychticholorate.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Glass?
-- Another backdraft.
No it couldn't.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
And the putty around the door?
Are you going public with this?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Like it never happened...
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
No need to be modest, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Coffee sucked.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Did he tell you how we finally met?
And the world -- the whole world.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Investigator Rimgale.
You mean you could use it.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Ho!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Meaning?
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Manray needs a job.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We're starving.
How you sound?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Exactly!
I don't know about that plantation angle.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
It's been a long time.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Where do you go from here?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Do you know how you will use him?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
I don't want to hear it.
Light?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
He, I'm Mona.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
No.
Yeah.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
What's a Negro.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
The one with da big...
Oh her.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
My people love me.
Y'know what?
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
What is your uncle's name?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
The coward!
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Have you not a man whom you value?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
It is my only object.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
All right, five hundred guineas.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Fine.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Can anybody hear me!
HEY!
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
That son of a bitch.
I'm serious --
And the bodies?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Would you have believed me?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Do I?
You hated West more than any of us.
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
I didn't --
Maybe --
And the problem is you only got three.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're drunk --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Yes.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Watch me.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
You mean the falsely accused?
Nah.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
What?
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
We know.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Edward Bloom.
I brought it.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Please. Go. Just go.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
I like your stories.
Really?
Okay.
Beats me.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You think I'm up for it?
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
What did he say?
What?
You think I'm fake.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Story of my life.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Really.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I do.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Yes.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
What do you mean?
Do you want to stop?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Uh... Yes.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
You can stay tonight.
John.
What? What does he want?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sorry?
Yes I know.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Why not?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Sometimes.
Why?
Get out.
Well what have you got?
What?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
It's not mine either.
Maybe you will find out.
Right.
Just wanted to see.
You take her to a doctor?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You liked what I brung ya?
That'd be nice.
At church?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
No, ma'am.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah.
She's around. Always is.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
And you gonna live it with him?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Come on, gal...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
What do you want?
Whose doin' is that?
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
We drinkin' buddies now?
I ain't in a hurry.
The... chain helps.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Looks like you know a song.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Huh?
Nuh-uh.
Like I told you.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Or what?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
You could put it that way.
What's on your mind?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Holy shit!
The hell are you talkin' about?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Thought you had a man for that.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Thanks.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
What?
The Wolf?
Saving your life.
Number five with a bullet.
I didn't know.
Nick, we can't just --
What does Charlie mean?
Give me a break, would you?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Give us a break...
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
I can see that.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Sure.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Shut-up.
A resort city, Beppu.
What...?  Why?
Let's go.  Him first.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
A wife.  She left.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
I don't remember you saying no.
Tell them I'm not.
What if I chant?
Time, I've got plenty of.
He was my partner.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I have to get to Sugai.
I want him.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You want him dead too.
Not to be trapped.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
I am?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Well, actually
His company made us.
Just thought I'd...
You didn't like her!?
Your customer, eh?
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
I know all that.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Shot of vodka, please.
Ya.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Four years.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm taking a piss.
Meaning?
Huh huh.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
Too old.
What night?
What's suck night?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
I bet I would.
Of course not.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Can you?  I couldn't.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Me and my dad.
Dead.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
What?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
I never felt better.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Go ahead.
Five, maybe six.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
They left.
Thanks.
What's your problem?
Thank-Q!
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Yes, ma'am.
Young man, stop right there!
Oh, brother...
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
No, you get out of here.
You're lost?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Heck, no!  What?!
Perry?
I haven't brushed yet.
No.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Two weeks.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Sorry!
Good for you.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Yeah.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Do I look crazy?
Good-bye!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
But, Eve, I would--
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Sing it to me.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Then why go there?
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Yes, father?! Yes?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
True.
Almost all of them.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Yeah...Seems to.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Hi.
I'll be all right.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What?
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
No.
All our friends...
If I...you know...
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Yes...
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Mutants?!
Well, I am the head of this household--
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I think...it...works.
Always good advice.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
You're goddamn right I am!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Um...uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Roger, Wolf One.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You did? A human ear?
It must be great.
Yes?
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yes sir.
Jeffrey.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
I'll go then.
No.
Do you know?
I, uh.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
No, it's not Don.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Those are my breasts.
Nothing.
Be right down.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't know.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Two.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Okay, Sandy.
Goodnight.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
What is it?
No.
No Jeffrey!!
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Aye.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Where's your gun?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
I-I'll tip her.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Right.
Aye.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
No pictures, either.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Yes.
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
You... oh god, why?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Sicilians.
What about one guy with two guns?
Twist of lemon!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Just called ta torture us did ya?
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You feel?
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Yes.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
You think we're going to be chased?
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
We know there's another stocker.
We got it. We got it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll say it.
On your marks...  Get set go.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
As long as he gets out OK.
Where was it parked?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
You don't know how to hotwire.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Shut up!
What is it?
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yes. I do.
Any activity?
It's going back down.
Let's go. Come on.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
We're not sure.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
You're kidding.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
What do you mean?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Yeah. He said that.
OK, Dad.
No, I don't mind.
No. I wasn't adopted.
It was stupid.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Who's got the car keys?
Cuba.
You're Anthony?
Abdul-Shabazz?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
It's true, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
His name was Swifty?
That's too bad.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Don't count it.
I told you they were there.
He wouldn't move.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
What is it?
Bullshit.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
I'm working on it.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
He's damn good.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
Well, I left some money in there.
She is a good looking woman.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Mr. Henry?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
I want to know about Treadstone.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
Don't you want answers?
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
No. You lost your way.
The sooner the better.
And?
Keep going...
Okay... 
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
You killed them.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Conklin.
I don't know.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
No. There's nothing new.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
What?
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
What's that?
I'm working on it.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What? The tapes?
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Me? Four years.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
By who?
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
And what about you, anything?
I don't want to leave.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
It is suicide.
He has already agreed to come.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
That depends on the man.
I could crush you like a roach.
A common thief.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Let her speak.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
I... accept your proposal!
...Tonight!
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
It does me good to see you.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Great. I'll see you soon.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How long will I be in here?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
You know my father?
Photos?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Like how?
What?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Why's that?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Know what?
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Been there, done that.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Y... yes. I guess I did.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Oh my God oh my God...
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
My husband is with me, too.
Oh, yes, please.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Come up here a minute.
It's not for sale.
Suppose we do.
What are they?
And the other alternative?
He hasn't played it in a long time.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Has it got a wow finish?
Yes.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
And Laszlo?
No, not yet.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
He suggested I ask you.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
How do you do?
Go ahead.
What of it?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Thank you.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Yes. What is it you want?
Very well.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
May we proceed with the business?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I expected no less, Captain.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Mademoiselle.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
But I have no excuse to close it.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
What, again?
Our entertainment is enough.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
His escape.
He'll take one.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Put that gun down.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Hello Ugarte.
-- You thought what?
Shut up and go home, will you?
No, I don't.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
You are.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
You smell like formaldehyde.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
Could you watch Jango?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
I most definitely say I am.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Yeah.
Mom, meet Jango.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
I braided them.
Believe me I know.
Deep, real deep.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
They just want you to hire some new help.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Yes, I *have*!
I never said they were boring.
Well, they aren't.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
His father's dead, right?
I don't remember.
It's okay--I don't mind.
A B-24 Liberator.
Have you enlisted?
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Actually, I volunteered.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
We see you next harvest.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Everything looks in order.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Two million.
Know who I am, Jake?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
I was doing it for them.
After you cut her loose.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Well, this is just fucking great...
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I have a good crew.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Don't worry about it.
What?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Don't ruin this for me.
Sounds respectable.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
You sure?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
And we got rid of the red head.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
With identification.
I'm sorry.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Keep it up.
Eee Oott Auught!
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
I try.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
That's what I'm talking about.
Jack Manfred.
It's the tension.
I despise the job.
Sorry.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Habib?
South African women are very sporty.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
You mean I won't resist them.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
How did you land that?
Tension. It'll go.
Do you have to swear all the time?
I'm on at nine.
Leave it.
I hope it brings you luck.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Well, thank you anyway.
Your father?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I don't gamble.
That's fine.
I'll watch.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Then you're not a pro.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
No thank you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
You did?
Thanks.
You've done pretty well.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
That bitch? No.
I don't gamble.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I don't gamble.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Fine.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I can see.
Oh. What's wrong now?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb?
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Of course.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
...nine seconds...
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Commander Powell is dead.
Who cares?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
It didn't work?
Sorry.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
I'm on a break.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What're you talkin' about?
None of your business.
Leave.  Now.
No.
What?  Where're we going?
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
It's a rule.
Yech...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
You lost me.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Can't help you.
Any idea when she'll be back?
I'll wait.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Straight.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
They're prisoners to their genes.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
Lydia.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I'll give it my best shot.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Thanks.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
What's in Sandusky?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
YO, DOOFUS!
Check!
Damn straight we are.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Nah. Couldn't be.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Hawk?
It's my Bullworker.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
NOW!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
What?
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
So... that's it?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You have to do something for me first.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Sure.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Why is that?
I'm going home.
And you'd never been there before?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
With, like, images?
What?
Are you okay?
Who?
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
That is a terrible nickname.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
He said to follow him.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
What else makes you feel regret?
Thank you.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
You're not a bitch.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Raspberry.
She's alive, sweetie.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Yah?
Huh?
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
Yes, Leslie!
Bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
You could be quiet.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Loretta, shut it.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
My dress'll reek.
Yeah.
Ohio...
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Uh, Gladys?
We need more bars!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
"My dear President"...
"My President"...
"My"...
But you're my father -
Take a letter...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
I wanna powder my nose...
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't call him, I whistle.
Did you shoot the rapids?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Go ahead.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
No... it was a seven letter word.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
WHAT  ?
The king can do no wrong!
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I thought everything was working out fine.
How lovely.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
And here are my mother and father.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
That I am very little different from him.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
What do you mean?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Yes, I think I can.
Well, yes.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
No, but I certainly shall.
Oh no?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
y-y-yes--
Oh no, my friend...
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Not at all, John.
Of course.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Yes, John?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Fine.
I've heard.
Yes! The workhouse!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
A dressing bag.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Who, Father?
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
But, Father, it IS!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
That's right!
Not quite...
I shouldn't have come.
That I cannot tell you.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Shut up.
You don't love ME.
Oh, get it over with.
What?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Aaagh! Rape!
I didn't mean to!
What a stupid idea.
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
I know. I know.
That's my boy!
Sorry.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Like fish.
To the oars!
Who gets killed?
Keitel Blacksmith?
What are you talking about?
He hasn't.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Your lord.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it!
Mum! Dad!
What are you talking about?
I... I...
What have you got there?
That's right.
Help!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
But it's a responsibility...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Not now, Sven...
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Neither am I.
Me too.
No... he's not... not... there...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
In the room?
Okay, I guess.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Yes?
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
I like to read.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Very much.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You'll call me, right?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
You're not ready.
No. Thanks.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
What do you mean?
What?
I love it!
Is that what you want?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Okay.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Um, no.
I love you.
I don't know.
That's okay. I --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I guess so.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Guess what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
And what are you like? A wino?
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
You take it. I don't know.
Go back to sleep.
In a minute.
I hope you get your work done.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
We'll speak soon.
Very cool. Trippy.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
'kay.
We haven't checked.
That's a good one.
What?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Hi.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Welcome, Howard.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
He went home sick.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Yeah.
You can if you want.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Well.... er...
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Coop, where are you...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Hear what?
A power drain --
He's crashing...
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Start the countdown.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
...how's the client?
Skipper...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
I don't know...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Then who the fuck are you?
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Yes, sir.
Starck...
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
That's enough!
No, no, we just got her back together...
What's going on in there, Starck?
Not according to the computer.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Explosive decompression.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
I can't believe we built this.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
Victor did.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Victor must've taken him.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Five times.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Got it, teach.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Dude. That's my sister.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You were?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Hilarious.
Ben did this.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
They're not home yet.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I didn't say that.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
He's my friend, too.
You first.
I didn't see you this morning.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
All right, I take it back.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No.
All right. Pay attention.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
That's me, Merv.
Naw. Any good?
All right.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Just be glad you're all right.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
It was okay.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I think they're both virgins.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
That's the name they gave me.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
All right! Oh, yeah!
We keep them.
Do you want to come inside?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
I'll get you the notes.
I'd like that.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Righto!
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Dobermans don't talk.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Not much. Why?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Where'd you get this?
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Nobody. I'm the maid!
No! I swear I'm not!
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
You and a lot of other people.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
Nah, I got the gun.
Her fella.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Come on, come on.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
What?
You weren't helpin'.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
We gotta try.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Oh.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Okay then.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Fully.
Holds four.
F-f-fuck you.
What?
If he doesn't shut up...
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
YOU'LL HIT US!
Whoa!
Not without you!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
I'm fine, I really am.
We all have to be strong, right?
I'd love to.
Well...
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
You see: We've got to change that name.
Thank you --
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I'd like nothing better.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
What?
Thank you.
Huh.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Who is she?
Frances.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Dick, we need some time apart --
What night?
You want his name?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
But I'll never win that.
Thank you.
No.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
He's a socialist, then?
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
...Then go.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Eight stories.
Yeah.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Frances...
No, Harry, I can't -- 
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I'm not sure.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Who're you?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I already have.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
And what's that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No!
You're kidding.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Then why weep for him?
What kindness?
The music? Or the fire?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
How did you find me?
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
It's been months. It's not like him.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Aren't you?
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your husband.
Not as weak as I.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
It is
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Open this door for no-one!
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Aye, Captain.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
No. He had more important work.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
A... week?
No. They don't.
Despite the lack of challenge.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
The strain was evident.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Somebody'll see.
For sure.
Is it stuck?
I'll spot you five points.
I don't believe you...
Dancer.
Whatever you make yourself.
That was the telephone.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Good call.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I call it my shower dream.
Umhummmmph.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
So do I just follow you?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
He's running the show.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Jacob.
He's my son.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
-- you got your microwave --
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Six-fifty.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
He signaled the Ranger.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Sight seein'.
She's in the other room.
Seth, if you were me --
Yes.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What?
No, I didn't.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Or what?
We are?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
It don't look together.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Who's "we"?
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Sir...
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
I'm sure it is.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
This has nothing to do with you.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
I saw an article...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Yeah.  Me too.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
"Dad."
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You knew about us?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
But we can get to the west side faster.
Sure. I'd like that.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
So have dinner with me tonight.
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
They are with me!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
Thanks.
Sounds like a big company.
Are you sure? How do you know?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
You were right.
Good idea.
How do I do that?
It's Raymond.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Is that the bathroom?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Yes. Good was done this .....
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
You have a better plan, Alex?
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
What?
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Excuse me guys.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
GO Commander.
Up.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
We're getting major structural damage.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
We need another one.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
Right.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Tell them? About...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Turn on the translation circuit.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Gwen...
Because it was on the show!
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Home.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
What kind of signal?
Because they're coming right at us.
They always say that.
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
The army can survive without me.
I?  You all know my history.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, general.
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
Yes, I believe so.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Uh... none just now, but...
I... they look both the same.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
I'm very aware of that.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
It is; we need you George.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
It's stupid, of course.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
You're right.
You spotted them, huh?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
What money?
In the can. That the money?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Who is this?
What three hundred grand?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Whatever you want, Ray.
That's right.
I'm a producer.
What've you got?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
You just did.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
But you work for the casino?
They always paid.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Twenty seven hundred.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Martin, look at me.
That's not bad.
Buddy?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Who told you that?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Right. See how your story ends.
Sounds fair.
Depends, who pays?
You thought I was faking?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Shylock?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
With that coxswain dickhead.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Morning, skipper.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
So we kill him?
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
The right way and the wrong way.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
So whoever did this might still be around.
Then you're a lucky man.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Greer?
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Doesn't matter.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Not our mystery guest again.
Victims of what?
Right here.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Alright. I'll be right up.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Maybe.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Better late than never.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Uh-oh.
What do you mean?
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Yeah, well... hi...
Why?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Hey Josh.
Forget it...
How perfect.
Good.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Okay, okay!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Let's go hassle Josh.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It'll only take a second.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Where did you get that?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Which one?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I don't believe you.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
He came into work.
I said "great"...
I need to talk to you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Nothing.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
That tape sucked, by the way!
God, fuck you!
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Wow!
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Good luck...
Yeah, well...
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Hooray for me.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
How can you be so sure?
Really?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Do you have anything to drink?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
But, I...
They're Seymour's.
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
That slut!
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Why don't we start with that next week?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
You never had it.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
We have hunted since childhood.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
But you said they were always old.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
This is more difficult-
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I do, actually; very much.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Four should do it.
Not even close.  What happened?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
We don't have a relationship.
Do you ever see him?
Does he ever mention me?
Certainly.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
I'll supervise.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
What are you doing up here?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Tonight?
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Do I?
Like what?
You were the one who got me in.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I'm Peter --
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
Huh?  What?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Eight o'clock?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Hi, Louis.
It's in the stars.
No?  What do I act like?
Out!
I'll scream.
All right.
You heard it?
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
The magic word is "please."
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Then my theory was correct.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Why not?
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do I say?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
You're coming back?
Yes?  Go on!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Do you want posters, too?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Gladly Caesar.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
On what charge?
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
They can't... if this is Rome...
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
So I understand.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Greeks?
Let him trust Quintus.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I killed too many barbarians.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Chain him.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
I'd love some.
No -- why should I?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I just want to tell you something.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
No.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Because -- I am.
Did you say rape her?
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
Tomorrow?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
Yes I am.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
I want you out of here.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
A single. Just for myself, please.
What? No. Nothing.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
No.
What?
Right.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
No.
I'm very neurotic.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Well I don't know.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Right.
Yes, I have --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
What?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Why don't you watch?
You're welcome.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
INADEQUATE!
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
What one.
There!
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
We don't.
Not exactly.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
What?
Kind of.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
What?
Don't talk about Elaine?
I was just kidding around.
But why shouldn't I?
You're not.
Don't start acting hurt.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
But if it's sickening for you --
Then give me your word you won't.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
When I go off?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Not if you don't want to.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
-- worried?
About what?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Oh no.
I've got to go.
Quite a while.
Mr. Robinson?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Splendid!
The pearls are in her room.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Why?
How?
Not with strangers.
Have you seen it?
That.
Dictation.  You know...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
You're very funny --
Will you do me a big favor?
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
So alone.
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I should like to smoke.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Shall I see you again?
When are you leaving Berlin?
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Why do you think --
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
How's the beautiful lady?
I thought she was splendid!
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
I did not ask your advice.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- that --
Yes.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
You pay me.
I got ten marks for that.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
That's from skiing.
What?
Definitely off.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Hello!
Well?
I understand perfectly.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
And I said we didn't.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
Good morning, Madam.
I wish to be alone.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Again?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
-- We must do something...
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well -- gentlemen.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I want to keep my teeth.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
And if you do it wrong?
You'll never shit right again.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
We're not really interested, Henry.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Well, make it stop!
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
I know.
But they must be! They cut glass!
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Perk.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
No. And you have to be.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
Get off the grift, Roy.
That's right.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
As though you do what I say.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
What?
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Scram. Go home.
Always, for you, baby.
Mm?
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Every day in every way.
Yeah? How?
What happened to Cole?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Open your door.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I saw her.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I'm happy the way I am.
) What?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Charming.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Detective...
It's Amy Kramer.
Doesn't look good.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No.
Forget it.
Yes.
I was trying to protect you from this...
John, you can't help her now.
I came to see you.
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
I did alright.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
But I've seen him!
He says things.  Bad things.
You can't expect us to stay here --
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Danny!!!
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Here.  Let me try.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No one.
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Tell them yourself!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
This room is full of ghosts.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home.
First Nagasaki--now this.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
You actually sold insurance!
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
To make an ass of yourself.
Out!  Out!
Thank God!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
He insults him all the time.
What's good about that?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Scat!
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
No.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
A trip, you mean?
It's so--so stark.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
What a honeymoon.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
No you're not!
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
No.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Don't!
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
I've literally got to run!
Would you say that again?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Now who's being cruel?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
King Arthur.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
It's trash now, like mine.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Yes.
That is sad.
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's alive!
I didn't know that.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
It's beautiful.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
That man is your father.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
He isn't any friend of Father.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Yeah.
Far as I know.
You figure!
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Marry me instead.
You're saying no.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
What?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
We met here earlier this evening.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Goodbye.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Do you want to take a session?
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Yeah.
Um-hm. Live sound.
You know her?
Do you know where she lives?
Half now, half later.
I am.
Ulcers.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Not very.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
I thought I was fucked up.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
But then you'll forget about me.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What are you paying me for?
No.
No.
They are?
Get out!
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Like what?
Just leave me alone.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where!
Yeah.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Well...
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
To anybody.
Who's that?
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Is this your shovel?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Nice to meet you.
Oh.
It's very interesting.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Look, the ice is melting.
I don't know.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
What was that?
With Life.
Well, why don't you?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Here.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
No. My uncle.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Like a tea ceremony?
Why?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Jeez! That's a great story,
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
God, that's terrible.
What?
If anyone can help, HE can.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Kyle, you don't have...
What are you talking...
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
And what about you?
The Cenobites.
See what??
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I'm lucky that way.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I knew those men better than you did --
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
No. Don't --
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Hostage negotiations.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Marco...
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Not much.
Sure.
It'll go in.
Julia's my second wife.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No!
You did this before, right?
Stay the fuck away from me.
Oh Christ.
No.
This isn't happening.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
Hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Not know.
What kind of doors?
Hell...
I said no.
Maybe.
Which is where?
Oh my God.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
I'll be scarred for life.
Can I get you anything?
Fine.
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
Do you care ?
No.
Maybe I will.
Wait a moment --
Try me.
I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
O.K.
Is Julia here?
I want to see.
That's right. Cointreau.
So lie down.
We walk.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Are you alright ?
Will you GO, damn you?
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
What's next?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
But now I kind of like it.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Ehh.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
How do you know about that?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
I have all of the others.
We work there!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Can I help you?
I understand, Dick.
Do it.  Do it.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
And do you like it that way?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Nevermind.
I haven't felt like it.
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
We'll talk some other time.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Nothing.
That bad, eh?
Mmm hmm.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Yes, of course.
Mmnn.
C'mon.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
What's the difference?
To make you feel better.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You're tougher.
You're being stupid.
Hi.  What are you doing?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Would you marry me if I was?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
What difference does it make?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Good.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
I'm sure it isn't.
Yeah.
That way.  You?
How's the store?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Well we don't.
Sure.
This one came unassembled.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
I don't follow you.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Tradition.
That bothers you?
Have you gone to the police?
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Follow me.
I see.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
You killed those other two.
What about that family in '31?
Is that a threat?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
You and I should talk first.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
Not even a single lifetime.
No!
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
It's like to kill me first.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
And you?
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Like you.
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Figure she's with him?
I don't know.
And the Bulgarian?
He knows I'm here.  How?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
You were never a kid.
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
Leave her out of this.
It's all we have.
Leave her alone.
No.
I presume it's a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A mystery.
His only kid.
We were very close.
Same.
Hildy!
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!

Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
What?!!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
Please! Will you just --
The insurance business?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
We're not interested.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Louie!
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Is this the Community Hospital?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Murder, uh?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
What's that -- what's that?
You know you did!
What?
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Yes, sir.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
Now, where is he?
Little rum in yours, too?
Good coffee, isn't it?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
Yeah. But I --
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Fred!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
I did.  Hold the wire.
What?
I never saw him before!
I was just going to!
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
What did you do with her?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
No -- what?
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Mother!
That man there!
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Very simple, Earl.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
I won't, Earl. 
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
They're not human!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Ssh!
Get the Governor on the phone!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
The what?
Hello, Mollie.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Apparently so.
Who told you that?
They're not.
Yes.
Sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Please yourself.
I will if you will!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
What's that?
Jam.
It looks....foreign.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
No, I won't.
Who said anything about love?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Play something, Grace.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, that's a long time.
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Yeah, I'll do something.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
How awesome?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
I'll help ya.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
There's not enough room.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What?
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
What I need are some answers. 
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
That's nice.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Tickets for what?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
When?
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Sleeping.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Not yet.
Yep, I suppose it is.
You find something, Georgie?
Yes, sir.
What do they call you, sweety?
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What! God damn, how many?
Who's your Daddy!
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Call Wydell.
Right.
That's it?
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
I always favored the Hulk.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Gabrielle.
French?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
When you were a little French girl?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Hmmmph.
Not in front of the boy.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
No!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Oui.
We still have you and I.
Please let me go with you.
It's okay, Puff.
Very well.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Ouch. Yeah?
Always. Ow.
Shut up and tell me.
One night stand?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I think I'm going to.
Oh, Rosie.
With pleasure.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Paper or cloth?
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
I'm just preoccupied.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Oh boy!
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Yahoo!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Got it.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Yes... Derek.
Mm hmm.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
That's right, Miss Packard.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Thank you.
Good, good.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Yeah? Why?
I lost twenty bucks.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Whaddya been so far?
For who?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Hi. How's business?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Well, I win sometimes.
I said we're leavin'.
It's a long walk.
You want me to tell her for you?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Want some free advice?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
I told you you'd get your money back.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
How much?
Would you like to come out tonight?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Okay?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Yeah, sure has.
Yeah. Sure.
Couple of bucks.
What?
Eight o'clock.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
A loser?
Would he know?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Come here. Come on, now.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
No.
Yes.
What?
You're not them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
Yes.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Round back.
If we want it, it is.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
What did it look like?
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I'll take you to school.
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
George, you're acting very strangely.
Why, yes.  Why?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I don't see anything.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
Hide the car.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
You have to leave the White House.
David, don't...
If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
That signal. It's a countdown.
I'm thinking.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
College nickname.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Then find them.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Roger.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
It had been deemed classified.
Butt-munch.
I'm a dancer.
It's all fuzzy.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
It looks like a converted church.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
What?
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
We're through!
What?
You said go between them!
Mine, too.
You had it? You didn't trust me!
Don't know. Think of something.
Junior!
There were rats, Dad.
Will you take it easy!
She talks in her sleep.
What???
What?
Brody's this way.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
What did you find, Dad?
We named the dog Indiana.
Ready.
After you, Junior.
That was seven hundred years ago.
Come on -- come on!
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
My name is Kazim.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Miss Scott panicked?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
There are no stories anymore.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Siam.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Just one arm!
I know the feeling...
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Maybe he likes older women.
No -- real food.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
A what?!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Quiet!
I'm going down.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
And they don't even know what it really is.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Al ???!!!
Where are we now?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Kill myself.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Outrun them.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Don't know.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
The beach.
Just get there.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
You're out of shape.
How should I know?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
What?
Well you did it today.
What are you looking at?
Not blue enough.
Why not?!
The beautiful one.
Who, me?
Just hold them close and stay still.
Oh come on.
I don't know!
That's not funny.
Drink lots of water.
I can't see a thing.
You were with GRUNER!
And Dieter?
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Where've you been?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Now, you're too suspicious.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
It's all we've got.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
Don't worry.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Who's our little man?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
He work for us?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
It's just money.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
How do I look?
Oh....Sure.
Oh yeah, thanks...
Been hearing voices.
A little voice in my head.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
What's what?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Without what?
You are.
You talk to yourself.
Why do you do it?
You're doing...Okay.
Is that Ryuji?
Why'd you run off?
Wanted to get to know you.
How do you know you can trust me?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
He plays it all the time.
You coming along?
This going to work?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I told you, I work for him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
...Piece of mind.
It is?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
For reading.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
In the backyard.
What? Forget it.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Soy sauce...
I didn't want to leave it there...
"60 Minutes"?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Hello? Yeah...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
You eating with us?
What's this?
What?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Did work.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
You okay?
Good.  You have kids?
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
When should we do this?
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Chapter and verse.
Well, I wouldn't say --
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Is that... one person?
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
I should be in therapy.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Asian? No.
What?
Yes?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
I know you do.
And you've always loved him?
To him? He's a sick freak.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Marylin! Listen to me.
So I hear. Is that all?
Have you tried the duck?
She didn't love you?
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
You can't prove anything.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Marylin?
Please! Leave the house.
Sometimes I forget.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Jesus.
He was right, wasn't he?
Of Massey Myerson?
I'm dying.
So where are you now?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Excuse me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Thank you.
I don't know. I can assume...
No. You're not.
HA!
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, no.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Sock her!
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Are you talking to me?
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
The pleasure is all mine.
I can't go out like this.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Um. You're doing all right.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Next week "East Lynne."
You always want to run everything.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Yes.
You're prejudiced.
was so scared—that it scared—
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I hate the horrid stuff.
What for?
Come on—get in.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Not interested. 
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Husband?
Isn't he here?
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Get out!
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Well, I'll be—
Okay, pete. 
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Collect?
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
Thanks. 
Why?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
There were no phone records.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Go on, Willie.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Where you going, boss?
There's a word - orders.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
What did they...
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
And then Sunday?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
David Ferrie.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
How many men?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Allen Dulles?
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
We need him back.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Never touched me.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
The assassination, Jack?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
She's the best damn witness we have!
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
And what would I have to do?
Yes?
That sounds fun.
Six.
Uh huh.
I understand.
I won't forget.
Who was there for your ass?
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
I need a favor.
Course you didn't.
In his inside coat pocket.
I found out.
She wants to go back to work.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
Sure.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Take your time.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Fine.
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
Why does it need to be dark?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Shit.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Are you?
How'd you find that out?
It's not really something I think about.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
I'm old enough to be her father.
They seem to like the idea.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Why?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Do you think they bought it?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
It's not that simple.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Can I smoke?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You talk to him?
Who's the other one?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Do you got something for me?
Got some o.j.?
Sure.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I told them.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I'll give ya ten.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Designer clothes.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Uh-huh.
Bank robbery.
The roller disco one.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You lived in Japan, when?
Does that bother you?
Uh-huh?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Who's your partner?
C'mon in.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Not now, pick me up.
I shot her.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Pretty sure.
What?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
Fuck you for asking me that.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
How am I supposed to know that?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Have her bring the money here.
You expect me to just walk in there?
I know where it is.
Yeah.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
No, thanks.
Like Della.
Hello, Sam.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
They're not interested, Jake.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
... I've seen them, too.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
How do you know?
What did she have to say?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
You should go back to her.
What?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Jacob Singer.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Don't move me.
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Don't ask.
Your kid dropped it off.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
A good lay.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Lemme see.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
What's wrong?
Where?
What kind of man are you?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
What?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
What? What do you mean?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I love you when you're angry.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Then don't bug me.
Mid-town mostly.
Don't be funny.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
The Ladder?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I no from around here.
They're awfully heavy.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
If you're lucky.
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Where am I?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I need to see you, Jake.
I need to see you.
Nope.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
Who is?
What do you mean?
You've seen them?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
How did it happen?
Punk?
Speaking of which, duck!
Pause play.
Alright, asshole.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Thorgan, pull us in.
And you said high school was boring.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
I don't know!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
What?
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
What if we don't?
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
I know you.
I get it.
She broke my fucking nose!
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
NO!
Just get us to the ship!
Let's just get out of here.
Would you?
Maybe she tripped.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Exactly.
Sure, Dad.
Here --  Take him home.
What do you mean 'We...?'
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Where...?
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
Full throttle! To port!
He's taken him!
I never hear the whistle.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Michael! Come inside!
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
What'll I tell the kids?
Do I need any more authority?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
My kids were on that beach...
No, we just checked the beach...
Let's all have a drink.
Rogue?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I can't imagine why.
Do I set the goddam hook?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
He's busy.
Transplants?
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
No way! He can't!
He's under!
I'm supposed to be running.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Or something.
I'll try to drop by later.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Um, hi?
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
What are you talking about?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I'm a junior.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Blood and guts.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Oh.
Yeah.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
I wrote that.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
You know... it's parts...
Hey, I like this.
That suits you.
Why?
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
God, you're so young.
Really? Fingernails?
Vanessa, right?
Nothing...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Tore up from the floor up?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Share the love, Tits!
What?
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
They're yellow.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
It's a loft.
Carrie.
He whips you?
Could I try that?
...That's not true.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
What'll we do out there?
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early, sing me a song.
No sir.
Best kind.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Thank god!
...I do.
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
...just like that?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I'm finished.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Where's Adele?
Siesta.
Everybody just shut up!
...You're hurting me...
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Where would we find him?
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Was up bitch?
You fucked it?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
Yeah.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Den less go Joe.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
Who?
Darcy?
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Why I do what?
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Yeah probably.
Hold up man.
Yeah.
Na.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
You were?
I like you too.
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
No.
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
I know.
Mine?
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Making love is like.
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
What?!
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Yep.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
What are you saying?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
No it wasn't.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Get off me!
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Sanderson?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did you know her?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
No!  Wait!!
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Why did he what?
That has nothing to do with it.
Thanks, David.
Who's Kathy?
Bingo.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Yeah.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
It's important.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
I went out.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I want to be the best I can.
No.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Yes.
Yes.
When I was very young.
It is.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
No.  You were talking about chess.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
You don't understand.
It's not that easy.
But I do.
I'm sure you are.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Thank you, but I can wait.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
I chose the wrong passage.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
No! You cannot know that!
You have done it?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
That I promise you.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Would you settle for a boar?
I cannot go with you, my friend.
And mine goes with you.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
It's right behind you.
Would you desert your friends?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
We have plenty of hares.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
Look at its insides.
Then he will die!
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
With an old voice?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
She has the power to kill.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
That is true.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No?
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Whoever.
Yes, yes...
OK.
Yes.
No.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...Later.
...I don't know.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Mathilda, listen!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
I have no fear.
Huh?
Huh? Why?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yes... Twice.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
I have new dreams now.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
No it's not.
What?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
I won't let you die.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
What?
I don't follow.
Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
You like to take walks?
Please tell me.
You've just decided, is that right?
It'll make it.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Not our problem.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
Nine.
Pulitzer, here I come.
California.
She knew you loved her.
I do.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Good morning.
Forty-seven years.
What?  Who are you?
Evening News?
...Noooo.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
No -- S.E.R.A.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't be silly?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
I know that...
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
We?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
They wouldn't know.
Yes.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
Go to hell.
Are we done for today?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
How?
I believe you! Don't worry.
I guess.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Just the love in my heart.
What?
-- uh --
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I don't know.
Definitely! I love him!
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
You're kidding!
What?
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
You think?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
What?!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
I wasn't gonna --
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
No, she can't move for an hour.
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Oh, my God!!
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Maybe she found him like that.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Do anything exciting?
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Really?
Yes.
Cunnilingus?
Then we smash 'em?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
What will become of me then?
I see...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I don't expect you'd understand.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
I fear she's lost.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
And who might that be?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Blackheart?
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
There's the way, mates.
We'll find it.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Will you chance a miss?
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
It doesn't matter.
The wound is mortal.
I don't... understand.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Sapphire!
I'll try.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
I'm not its master.
Shhh!
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
My own father...
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
You're teasing still.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Lili... I love you!
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Dead, dead, dead.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
You... you... you mortal you!
I think she's about to foal.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
The Black Baron, you say?
I wanna be with you today.
Since seventh grade.
Who are you?
Uh...using Josh like that.
Who are all these people?
No.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Where to?
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I can use your mom's.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
Are you afraid of heights?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
We've known each other since grade school.
If that's what it takes.
It's thirty feet.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
How old are you?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
Thank you.
We're getting out of the ground today.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
I almost saw Catalina.
Why?
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
How do you become something you're not?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Are you taking them still?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Ring the bell before you try the door.
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
Why would they tow your truck?
What?
I dreamed about your house last night.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
I think so.
Going on?
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
No.  Mostly me.
Left you?
What did he say?
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
What?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
I never asked for more.
Please don't leave me.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Do you like red?
I didn't go in your room.
Yes, it is.
Nigger.
And the baby?
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
She got married last month.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, boss.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
Here!
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He's dead.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
He does it all by himself.
What about you, Radio?
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Claude.
Yeah.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I don't know. Who do you want?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
What am I gonna eat?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Make 'em throw strikes.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
That's the way it is.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
'Course I was right. About what?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
I try to moisturize regularly.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Just like Elvis.
Rayford!
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
He must still be in there.
I prefer bourbon.
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Me? Willie Long.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
What do you think about... Earth?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
All right. Let me out.
Noon...
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
My mom wasn't a goat?
An angel?
Yeah, you do...
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
No.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
What can I do about it?
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Release the evil?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Coulda been much worse.
That's a pretty brassiere.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Should we wake him up?
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Dude. Seriously?
I'll just go to Heaven.
You smell like coconuts.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
"Octopus people?"
School?
Sometimes, sure.
Are you dead?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I love you.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
I don't know.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I don't know?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
From? From? From?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
I'm in my party mood.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
It has nothing to do with you.
I'm very smart.
No.
Jessica.
Why is it wrong to run?
K.
I'm going to run.
It's different now. Help me.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
He's good, isn't he?
We'll convince them.
How will they know we're coming?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
All this. All of it.
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
For as long as I can remember.
Gracious... no.
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No, no, no
Not yet.
More... many more.
Oh my... I'll try.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
I used to.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Yeah. Call him.
Oh, yeah?... What else?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Do ya good.
What happened to me?
No.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
No... I don't. Why?
I don't know yet.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
That's absurd.
What are you going to do?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
What night?
Why would anyone do something like this?
What job?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Yeah.
At your house. Don't you remember?
What night?
Sure. Sure I do.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Thank you.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Yes.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
I'm thinking.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
In a quandary.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Gold. You were going to—
All right.
No.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Look, Bob!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
How do you do?
That's intelligent.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The only one.
Shall we have another?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Then it's done.
How can we get in touch with them?
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What do you mean if we should get out?
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Let me go, Bob!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Where are we going? Huh?
That was easy. I read your books.
Yes, I know.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
All right, I'll be there.
Hesitated, sir.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Yes, sir.
Well this didn't.
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Yup.  Sure is.
Sir--
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
You don't know the half of it.
I taught kindergarten.
It was a long time ago.-
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
They respond to fear, right?
You're not taking me in!
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nothing.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Actually, yeah--
How'd you know that?  Kay?
Come again?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
They went right to the President.
Where's he making his big speech?
Did it leave?
Oh shit!
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
He'll turn around.
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
What --
I know... I do, too...
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
How do I find the --
Lara --
Don't worry, Lamar.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Everybody runs.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
No maglev system.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
That was easy.
Yes.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
I need your help.
I need help with her.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
They don't belong to anybody.
That's great.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
Who said I would?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You say some of the children died?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Sean --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Tell him not now.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Where are you?
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
How many?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
We used to, every summer.
What does he want with a precog?
You're Bobby, right?
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Is it the good room?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Manhattan.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Holy shit.
He's alright.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Chloe?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Yeah? You sure?
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
This one?
Pshhh...
No.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Yeah.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Thanks.
What about boxing?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you.
I got no idea.
Shhh...
He didn't say we need guns.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Is that the woman from..?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Nothing.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Don't even start.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
The what?
Did you hear what he just said?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You're out of money?
Eighty bucks?!?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
No more, man.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
What do you mean 'kinda?'
The line's over there.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
S'up.
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Where do you live?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Here...
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Word.
The Soho Grand?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes, sir.
She poured it for --
Outfit? What's he talking about?
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
Man's rep travels.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You never had it.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
Yeah.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Okay, okay.
What do you do with your time?
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
No, Brother Minister.
She ate.
Are you?
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
Yes.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Hush your mouth.
You're with me even when you're away.
What do you think?
I'm not made of glass.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Shhh!
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Just what is your question?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Sure, man.
What?
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
What does Sidney say?
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
You're too small to be Bogart.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
Are you sure?
Allah will provide.
I don't know shit about you.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
So you are going to talk me to death.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
So what do I get in return?
I'll call you tomorrow.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Daniel what?]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[You stole the drop.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Yes.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
If they like me.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Who's Emilio?
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It's better to be free, right?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Yeah. Two or three.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Still not a question.
Frank. Frankie.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
No.
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Don't forget your towel.
Our daughter.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
I already ate.
That's what friends do.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Where?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
What for?
Where you going?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
You told me.
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Nothing.
I'll wait for your call.
Nothing.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Tomatoes.
You gonna get married.
You gonna die without a son.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
What didn't you like about her?
Waddaya read there, Joe?
What nurses?
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Well...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Sure, sure.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
You talked to Walt?
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Never this close.
How you, Radar?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Back home.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
Perfectionist.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
We're a good team.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
A football game?
What?
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I like an olive.
An eternal damnation.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
I don't get it.
What do we do?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
I think we could still have a chance.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
The one and only.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Morning, Captain.
Damn.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Now?
Nice.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Against what?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Money.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
What letter?
What John Doe?
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Sorry.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
Take it easy, John Doe.
No.
He's watching the other door.
Beany!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
. . . Tubby?
The heelots!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
It must be some kind of a gag.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
John Doe Club?
You betcha.
Yeah. It certainly is.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Well?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, I didn't.
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
No.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
No, sir.
Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
SWAT wants to go in.
Yeah, okay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
They want Walter dead!
I need to get something straight first.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
...a car.
Spread it out.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Only at the very end.
National Marksman Competition.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
I don't really like to drink.
I don't gamble.
Do you really?
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Okay, stop.
You're a compulsive gambler?
I have two words for you... Seek help.
I do.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
Yeah, first and second.
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Good question.
I ain't interested in your life story.
What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Greg.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
You heard.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
And it's hard to get.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
It's very nice.
Use your imagination.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Prude.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Who's running it?
Who's running it!
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yes.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
True.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Wake up?!
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
-- He will.
At least a day.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
What?
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
The truth.
Insurance.
If she's alive, you get it back.
No.
-- The inside?
Yes.
It was a test.
Not you.  A copy.
-- Waiter.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Yeah, right.
... Let's take a look over there.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
What's a Triac?
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
A real shame.
Look closer.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
You want me to place a few calls?
GO POWER RANGERS!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
And I ain't no nigger either!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
But I've never served a day.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
But ya got a Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Long as Charlie says.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
I can just imagine.
I was calling yesterday.
It's a mask.
It's too late.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Like a party for all our friends.
Come off it, Bugs.
They don't give a shit about us!
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
I know about you.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
What about the share.
I got partners.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Fuck 'em.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Anything!
That a Jew compliment?
I don't know. I guess it was...
I didn't say anything.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
<u>Why</u>??
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Thank me next time you see me.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Ohhh, nothing.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
He called me "Doc."
What's the "bad" part?
I'd better go report this...
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
The ring...
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Uh-huh?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Moscow.
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
I did not--
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
It couldn't be.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Yeah. What about the second act?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
I'll cherish ya.
What?
Okay--I mean--
No--not offhand--
Take me home, Diz.
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Ma! Hold him!
Oh, a *boy*!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
For a question!
I yield.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he yield for a question?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Office of--Senator Smith?
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Why?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Since sixteen or so.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Why?
I also answer to whistles.
No!
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Great.
Do you want to dictate them?
Don't mention it--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
And how's your bill, Senator?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
A Bill! Not *him*!
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Yes--
He's lost complete faith in me--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which I rose and gave to this body!  Mr. President--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. And now, he is trying to blackmail this Senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! To prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. I apologize to this body for his appointment--I regret I had ever known him. I--I'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and I refuse to listen to him any longer! I hope every member of this body feels as I do!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Always.
He sure is.
No, no children.
Yes!
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I—
Yes!!!
What did they say?
What's that?
I'm from a small town too, you know.
You have?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
He did?
Are you? When?
No, I don't mind.
No. It's nothing.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Hello.
Uh-huh.
Have lunch.
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Yes.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Shhh!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
This is outrageous!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
What for?
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Huh?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Huh?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
Shut up!
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Yes?
Not at all.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
I did what!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Good kids.
Hmm?
Uh-huh. What are they?
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Why's that?
A friend?
...And I from Phyllis.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
My approach?
Mr. Follett.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What?!
You are so mean.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Nope.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Tastes good.
I do.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Doc.  Ainge...
...so accomplished.
Lily.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
-- Go on!
No, I really don't.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Is that like a party trick?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
That's... good?
Of course.
Transference.
Hello.
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
Which show was that?
What do you want me to see?
Was it something that happened at school?
True. Should we stop them?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Don't you like this?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Uh-huh.
You don't think I'm insane?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I'm honored.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
Wow.
Yes, yes it does...
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
In the desert? What for?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh yes, always.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Perhaps.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
Want to know?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
The things that get you excited.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Way to go, Evy.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
You have got to be joking?
I'll be down in a jiffy.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Thanks.
Really?
Why not?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Curiosity.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Alone tonight?
Why?
It is?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
What?
Yes.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
And you are a fool.
LOOK!
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
Not a chance!
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
So you're chicken?
Oh shut up.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
No.
The Eradicators!
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Definitely.
The bazookas?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Great timing!
With or without him, we gotta go!
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
I think it's absolutely charming.
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
I did, sir.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Are you serious?
Bertrand, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
What is that?
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Would you like some brandy?
Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare.  You must wear long-sleeved and long-legged underwear.  You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
And you, Junot?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I don't understand you.
Open the door.  It's me.
Five minutes.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
I couldn't face telling you.
I know.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Oh, then you are...
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Does she deserve anything better?
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
That is a matter of opinion.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
I don't know!
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I'm his cousin.
Yes you did.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
You don't know Baby D.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
What's the B-G's?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I don't know.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
It's alright.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Have you seen Day-Day?
I saw it.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
Negative...they vamped.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Let it go!
Why did he go in the house?
Go for it.
Call me.
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
That ain't gonna work.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Huh?
Good, let's get out.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
Oooh, ba-by!
It's an important speech.
Uh, yes..
Oh, yeah?
My security people are right next door.
No.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
The gun...
No, that's,..that's fine
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Nods.
Over and out.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Thank you.
I don't know.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I see. Where is this gun?
Laughs.
I've done much better ones than this.
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Come with me, honey.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Not even her?
No.
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
Yes! Yes!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
All to pieces!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Satan.
Amen.
How?
There! What's so hard about that!
Sshhh...
Hm?
John! Don't!
John, where are we g --
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
She talks to herself.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Huh?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I'll tell.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Mm-hm.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Naturally.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Can I have this?
No. No one never did.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
She turned me out of the bed.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
My flesh and blood!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What you been up to?
Now who was this?
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
No.
Uh-oh...
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Yeah.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Sure, but...
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
It wasn't that serious...
I will.
Great
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
S'curity.
Just sleep now, Mom.
We should get her out of here...
The door was locked from your side.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
Jungle man fix Jane.
Have you any money?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I have nothing to hide.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Tell me... what else did you have?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
...and little Lady Beatrice?
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
No, that's bad management.
No, no.
Monsieur.
You didn't get legal advice?
That's right.
The Duchess...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
I don't feel like any breakfast.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
No, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
What is it, my boy?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
It is Thursday!
It's a real Paris reunion.
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
No, no.
Comrade.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
No, thank you.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
Au revoir.
What business?
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
No visa.
Why should I take a chance?
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
You might hold this for me.
How long does it take a man to land?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Go ahead.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Yes.
He takes good care of that.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Thank you. Thank you.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
The bayonet? Did you really?
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
What are you after?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
No.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You must, darling.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Comrades! Good people of France!
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Please.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Good morning, Swana.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Oh, yes.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
What does he say?
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Months, Swana.
Yes.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I must ask you to leave.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I must insist that you leave.
Yes.
May I ask why?
No.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
Where is that?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Where the hell is he?
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
Uh huh ...
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
I figured that out.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
No, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
There's no secrets here, Al.
'Night, Al.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
Can we get around this, Al?
Yes, you approved it, sir.
"Security" is not strong enough.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
How is this national security?
Sir?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Sir?
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Sir?
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
For God's sake, when does this end?!
No ...
Why me?
Yes, Mother ...
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
My friends call me "Mister President."
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
What?
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
I always get my man.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
We'll see about that.
Agreed.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
What do you mean, Jack?
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Just ... uh ... you know.
Did you cry when he died?
Looks can be deceiving ...
I was the lesser of two evils.
Free, if you're the president.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
... but it was all we had.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hello ...
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
I know ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Are you serious?
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
I don't want them to love me.
Can I just ask for one thing?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
I've missed you.
They're all your enemies?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
When?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
The "crises"?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
Try "old" on for size.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
It could be.
Llewelyn Moss?
I don't know. He ought to...
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I ain't got the money.
No. But I gave my word.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
It's full a money.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Goin' out.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Is Llewelyn there?
You expect him?
Screwgie.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Sir?
Well...
You live in that house behind the store?
Sir?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Yessir. I understand that.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
Another additional.
I got beers in my room.
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
Yes sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
No, Elden, I need to...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
I know that...
Little place called "Williams," why?
I know plenty.
"Banners?"
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
"Thirty-two?"
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
What?
I gotta go make dinner.
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I got you, Del...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
It's not really a good time, guys...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Like Rome?
You made out alright.
He has no heartbeat!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The one you were telling me about?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Who?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
If we're for real?
Of what?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
You told me how to do it!
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
I know that.
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Better.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
David Ravell.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Gopher, Everett?
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
No weddin'.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You said -
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
It was in his bureau.
You didn't know that at the time!
Well that hardly sounds like you...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
But... but...
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Buyin' nipples!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Thank you, sir!
I joined the Navy.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Yeah, I know.
I wrote. Not every week...
Come over here where I can see you.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
It's important, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I called you Sarge.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Great.
Yeah... Mmmm...
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Not me.
I know who you are and what you want.
You're better than candy.
What's stopping you?
Does it still hurt?
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
So?
Why'd he do it?
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
But she expects you to marry her?
She didn't.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
I have the gun.
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
I did.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Oh, that phone call...
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
It's okay, Raoul.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
What?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Open the door.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I don't know, why?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
Come on, come on...
Blue is phones?
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Fuck that, we've got company...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Yeah, it's me.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
I don't know. Look around man.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Can you make a deal with them?
Are you finished?
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Wait a second there brother...
So what's the deal?
Right on Brother Judge...
They were empty...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Brimmer.
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't look alright.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Lovely.
With a lace table cloth?
Colonel will do.
Oh?
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Probably.
Oh?
Is that so?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Go on.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Thirteen years...
Name five hundred.
That's five, keep going...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.
Worse.
But father, they might come this way.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Is that right, dad?
Am I really gonna have my own room?
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Yaay!
Yes.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
You believe in it.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Yes.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
I guess so...but...
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
You don't understand--
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
And Church will be fine.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
I got eggs down here!
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
I'll torture it out of you.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Or you could surrender.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Can I trust you?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
Nor did you, I noticed.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
She can hold a bit longer.
We're catching up!
I know.  That was for the smell.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Indeed.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Pirate.
No.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
Agreed!
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
'Bootstrap?'
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes, I have.
And no lies!
Until he's done.
Speak.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
It's ready now, I know it is.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
No, Icky, this is real.
That might work.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Shut up and do it!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You're looking for a urine sample.
You know, this and that.
The big house?
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
What happened to it?
We don't?
The waste.
You're the doctor.
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Yeah.  Old times.
No problem.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Let's go.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
The same thing I suppose.
I have to!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
You were looking for us?
And you have him?
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Yes - Sing Sing.
Dexter.
Yes - isn't it.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
How-di-do.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What are you talking about?
Good morning. What does this mean?
You can't walk out of here like this.
You're acting like a child.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Why—
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Mother!
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I'm afraid.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Yeah - go on.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
My play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Sure.
No!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Yes.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
—and that—
Well!
It's the smoke.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Right!
Hello, Stew.
Yes - and I'd love it.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Right.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Very good.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
I have it here.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
And now for that twentieth crack—
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
I understand, sir.
No, sir!
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Looks just like it did.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I'm sorry ...
She's crying.
But I really should get home.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
I was in a bowling-alley.
I don't want it to go away.
Um ... It's ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
... Lover's Lane.
It is?
What are you doing?
With what?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Rain.
Still doesn't make it right.
Okay--that's enough!
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Green.
No way.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
Just take deep breaths.
What were you doing in a library?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Well if I don't who will?
It's fine.
Sure.
... Yeah.
That's great.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
I'm not sure.
Scout?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Right. And how did she dress him?
What department store did they go to?
McGinty's.
What the hell's going on!
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Listen to me!
... Yeah.
... What's that?
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
Yeah.
Hi.
I'll never be able to do that.
No, that's not it.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
This is "Fly With Us?"
That's it.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
So it's ok if I bring her.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
No.
It's fine, but --
I have no idea.
Call me later.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Do you like porno movies?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
You sound very cute, very nice.
No.
Georgia.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Yeah.
No. I'm sorry.
They don't get opened until eight.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yes I do.
It's terrible, no.
Are you guys hurt?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
No, no. I did.
Yeah.
Nothing.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
You don't think you'll go --
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
...I don't know what you mean....
Thank you.
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
For what?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
337.....I'm sorry....
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
That's that.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Hi Walter.
Like a psychiatrist?
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
You're goin' on a trip?
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Ok.
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Hi.
You have another house somewhere or something?
Alright, alright.
You can't be late.
Seriously.
Seriously.
Don't puss out.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Ok.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Ok.
Ok.
Ok.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Yes, Abbe?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
Mustn't do that, sir.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
His rug.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- that was lust --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
And his writing?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And place my reputation at stake?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
No. It most certainly was not.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
And my own.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
There's something else I want from you.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
Oh, but I am!
Forgive me, I beg you --
But it's just begun --
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
He needs me here.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
My name is Orson Welles
To make pictures.
Yeah
You know that can't happen.
Why is that, Louis?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
Yes.
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's nothing to explain
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Yes?
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
No -- no -- I mean--
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Uh-huh
Nonsense
Telling stories.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
The old man has his own way of doing things
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Okay, boy wonder, what?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
She was . . . innocent
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I don't care.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Christ.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
It's too late. The movie's made
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
George...
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
That's for me to decide.
Again.
Again
CITIZEN KANE
They've all seen a rough cut
Then find another theater
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
It's not done.
No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Jack! Enough!
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Whadda you care?
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Give me a chance. Let me look.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
What do you mean?
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
No, I just told you what happened.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
It feels real good.
Should I hit it?
That's all right. He don't mind.
Come here.
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
What did I do?
I took the kids to my sister's.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
I am answering...
You did?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Why don't you just call him?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
He has it. Thank you.
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
You think I made all this up?
For instance?
I was jaywalking.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Your logic is backward.
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
Like an old hambone?
Congratulations, Jeff.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Did you get my note?
Lisa Fremont.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
I was.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You called the police?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
How much do you think you'll need?
Not too active.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
That's good news.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
I think it's enchanting.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Without any future?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Homework. It's more interesting.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
To get on home.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
That's what the witnesses told him.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Is he cleaning house?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Give me some dirt.
What?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hold it, Jim.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Stay here.  That was my son!
Plato.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Head-shrinker?
I know.  That's why I came back.
They're still there!
I'm here.  Shut up.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
Who?
No.  At dawn.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
My gun?
They like you.  Okay?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Goodbye, dear.
Good Lord!
No.
I don't know why--!
But you don't think that's a solution.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
Who lives?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Are you?
What?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
I'll never get close to anybody.
You said you'd call my father.
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Hi.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel!
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
YES!!!
...whoever she is.
Thank you.
No, no --
No, hey, I like your coat --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Beauty and fragrances.
We could live it up and --
Nick, no --
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
Nick, the ice is --
You saved me.
Don't say my name...
I don't know...
Part of... with them?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Who wouldn't.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
What college.
I don't know.
Five million?
And I worked there. For a year.
Why not.
NO!
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Take 'em.
What... Powwow...
OPEN IT!!!
We're aware of your position.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
Hi, Nick.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Standing right here, man!
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
GUARD!!!
I... sorry, Mister...
I'm ninety-two years old --
There is no other table --
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Was he all pissed off?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Pam Grier.
How can you tell?
Yeah.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
How many employees?
Like hell I am.
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Freddy Newendyke.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Nice Guy Eddie.
Joe.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
I don't believe in it.
A few cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do you think?
How can you be so sure?
Where?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
If we don't, he'll die.
That fuckin did it!
There's a slight difference.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Will she be dark or fair?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Hurry up.
Why?
So did I. They were in it.
Hello, Miss Wells.
A little hot.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
And meet him there.
How'd you happen to miss?
That's right, Steve.
I won't again.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
Nobody asked you to.
I said I didn't care.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
There aren't any women here.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Depends on how good you drive.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
He certainly could. About a month.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
I don't care what he thinks.
Everybody knows --
Don't you even know your letters?
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
No.
Would they be good to eat?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
And you've got me all figured out?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Never happened!
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
But he'll kill her!
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Just wait, you'll see.
My child, you're alive!
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Theo, did you see the animal?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Right. What about condoms?
What is it, Dwight?
What?
That's why we came here, remember?
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
Just a little experiment.
You do.
That's right.
Thanks, handyman.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
"Fucked me."
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Is there a killer loose?
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
This is so silly. 
You mean for TV or print?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Ooohhhh!
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Bon Appetit!
He's a good boy.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
Yeah —- sure.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Where?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Can we go there now?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
You could go and open the door.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
What sort of danger?
Hello, Frances.
But I like teaching school.
Nothing.
Yes.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
But you do believe me?
But you have treated me that way.
I'd like that.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
We could tell him.
That you love Mary.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Yes.
Devil worshippers!
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
But why come to me?
She was my patient.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
I'd forgotten.
Perhaps
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm afraid not.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I don't believe it.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
False alarm.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
What's the first?
How do you mean?
Impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Yes.
Everything about sex.
Yes.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Why?
Yes.
Yes.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you lied to her?
How come?
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Possibly.
I don't know.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
I guess.
Not really.
Why, so you can go after him?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Well, I wonder why.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
And... do whatever it is you do.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
What's wrong with that?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, what, then?
I can't believe you did that!!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Well. I can't stay.
There's a phone here.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Yes.
Very much live.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
Yes.
Different.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I did.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
In here!!
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
I wish you hadn't done that.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
No.  You said three-fifty?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You have family here also?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
Goddamit...
All right, jesus.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Was he nice to you?
Sure.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Down to the incinerator.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
We live in 703.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
It's crazy.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK. I'll think about it.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
A wreck.
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
You got it!
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Of course.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
YOUNG BLOOD
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
It'll just take a second.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
So I guess that's it.
Gary.
Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Well, in that case...
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
Well, she is cute.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
I will.  See ya!
What? Of course I like Christine.
Can you give me some room here?
Nope.
Shut up.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Thanks.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Uh-huh.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
What?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hold on.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
You need a new car anyway.
Maya, how are you?
I finished it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Try it.
I know. I love that.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
"The Day After Yesterday."
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Sure.
What about me?
Goodnight, Miles.
Well, nice to see you now.
What rehearsal dinner?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
So what's happening with your book?
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
See you over there, Miles.
I told you I need a drink.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
He had to make a phone call.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
It tastes old.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
No dad!
It tastes funny.
My ballet recital.
Who said I was going to die?
You love walks.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
I heard.
They already know we're here.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Me too.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Have they said anything about our area?
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Oh.
What's two?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
What was the first thing?
I would say so.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Pinned? What does that mean?
What did you say?
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Where were you?
Is he alive?
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
My name is Emmett.
Not for five years.
No, Leavenworth.
I expect.
Yeah?
I've got a job.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Why?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
We didn't get that far.
He'll be here.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Why would they stop you?
Good luck, Mal.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
It's been a while.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I just got to town.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You like a good saloon?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Spare me.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Soon.  Soon.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
No.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
When is she coming over?
Not quite.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
It was a great show, Dad...
So you did meet her?
Of course.
... so much like her?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please put your clothes on
You don't secretly want the attention?
Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Body double.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Why not?
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
Good for you, Hank.
I need flesh and --
I don't know anything about computers.
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I read.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Precisely.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
My God, you've got one?
What do you want -- ?
Is that why she left you?
Yes.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
-- What you don't understand --
... digitized.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
You use needles?
That's good.
How do you draw now?
He your best buddy?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
Words.
Something I want?
What?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
What?
Never mind.
Yes.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Maybe.
You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
Don't get mad.
Yeah.
They did?
They want me to do things for them.
...I don't know.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Stop looking at me.
Meaning?
What's a "little while?"
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Slut.
...Hi.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Sorry.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah?
Then why go back now?
Let it go.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Mmmm -- so can I...
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Bill, we need to talk!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
That's not funny.
Whatcha' doin'?
No. What…?
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Sorry.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
All the rib eyes?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
My present?
Grant, you're sick!
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
If...?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You know how rumors start.
Last year, this was a new rig.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Okay.
Having fun.
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
I give up.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Ummm?
And?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Well, thanks for the lift.
See ya, Kate.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Another time.
No.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
But I still don't think...
Yeah?
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Redneck heaven.
Can a pig whistle?
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
We'll be waiting. Over.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
What's that, pardner?
Go breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
About one to five years worth.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Now, you just find him, son.
That's correct.
You have a butler working that floor?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Yeah, why.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
They what? What? No. No. Why?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
I don't see it like that at all.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- okay, g'head --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
What are we talkin' on the split...
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
A Fed? Like FBI?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
I can trust Rheya.
You're not Gibarian...
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
He's dead.
Where's Sartorius?
That depends.
Shut up.
My wife.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
What is it?
Human beings can die.
I'll go with you.
I'll be right back.
You didn't look very happy.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What kind of look?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
No.  I love you.
Rheya.
He is.  But he was here...
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Then you won't make it.
I want you here.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Please.  Don't.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
They're kind of fuzzy.
I'll miss you, Mike...
What do you want?
Claire, will you calm down?
Let go!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
I don't know.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
Yeah.
Mike...?
Yeah.  It's all over.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
You don't want to hear about it.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I might stop you.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
You heard me.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
No.
I just sat and listened.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Be happy.  He's good at this.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
No, sir...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
What the fuck you doin'?!
Be nice.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
I know.
Hm.  What a lump.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Harry…
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Get away from me, freak!
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Hmf-hrr?
Just call me Spidey.
Thanks, I already ate.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
That's the understatement of the year.
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I don't care.  Cretin.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Looks good outside.
Coming up.
That'll do.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
That's right.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Why not?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
My legs are frozen.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Me? What if she don't want me?
What do they always say?
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
I'll open mine, too.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Yes, sir.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
We did it.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Give this to Joey, will you?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
What time?
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
When is it expected back?
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Wherever he wanted to be.
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Phasing? To where?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
No, I didn't know that.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
No, sir.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Thank you.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
David!... What went wrong?
Underground deposit?
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Logic indicates that is the case.
... How long?
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Sir...?
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Yes. And I know you.
The ship... Out of danger...?
She's to be decommissioned.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
About a dozen officers and men.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Any time.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Yes...
... Yes...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Yes... But -- how...?
Success, my lord.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Young. I feel young, Doctor.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
Carol!
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
I know, I know...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
I don't know.
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Give the word, Admiral.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
I am understandably curious.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Yes.
The power of creation --
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
Be careful, Jim...
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Who?
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
At what.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Engage warp engines --
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
... They do, indeed.
Just a couple of kooks...
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Please...
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
-- That's the general idea.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
... My shoes...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
It is.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
No, <u>my</u> name.
You play games with me and you're through
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
I suppose they told you that...?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Implicitly.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Noon tomorrow...?!
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Surely you can be more specific...
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Ah... The giants.
Yes?
I see.
The hell I can't
How will playing cards help?
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Right.  Will you help us?
They did, Admiral.
Weapons systems?
... Aye sir...?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Uhura!... Where!
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Just use the keyboard...
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Tell her I feel fine...
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Why?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
Sometimes I do.
Androids... don't have...fun.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Captain, Geordi...?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Will the structure hold if we blast through?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
It is not over.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
Recommendations?
You got me, Commander.
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Deck ten.
Commander Riker...
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Ask them.
Beam him out!
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Say the greeting again...
Why was Data assigned?
You should feel right at home with them.
Good question.
What...?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
I look forward to reading your report.
Yes...
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
At least four hours.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
I believe so.
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Let's go.
How serious is the damage?
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Ready.
California. San Francisco.
Something wrong with that?
The invasion plans.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Yes, he is.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
You're lying.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
No. It's a lot further than that.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
Fire.
Aye, sir.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Life signs?
Unless you'd like to stay.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Right.
I'll keep that in mind.
Hold that thought.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
The charge is murder.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
I didn't mean this future.
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
We were until your torpedoes!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
That's a comfort...
How can I trust --
Yes...
Yes.
I am.
Uhura, monitor!
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Shields up, Captain --?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Onscreen.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Candidate for what?
Captain, if --
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sulu!
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
You have personally -
I was asked by my father to open neg-
They're dying.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
So, that's it..
What peace conference?
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
Not yet... Section 4236...
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Confirmed, Captain!
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
I believe I am.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Good work. The download?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
Of you?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?

I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Make it so.
This isn't about me anymore.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Theories?
What do we know about the population?
What programs were accessed?
Sir?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
On screen.
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Your new chair, sir.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Praetor Shinzon?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
How did you end up on Remus?
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
New worlds.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
In time.
Why am I here?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
And what of the Enterprise?
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
He is what his life has made him!
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
I am.
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
We're being hailed.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Do as I tell you!
Seven minutes.
None.
You don't have to understand.
I don't think so... 
Sure.
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
Stay right there...
About five miles back.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
They must have picked it up in space.
It's in a green Mustang?
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Good.
Coupons.
Money.
What are you doing?
Gas good?
I am Jenny Haydn.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
No.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
When we get here.
Why?
Yes.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I must meet my ship.
You promised.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Yes, they are.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What for?
Yes.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
I must go.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I will.
You could have killed us both!!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Bullshit!
No.
Twenty-eight years.
It was a man though... right?
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Yeah, right.
No problem.
My God.
Watch and see.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Step into my office.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Shutup a second!
I'm on her.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
W'sup, Max?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I won't say anything.
Naawww.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Sleaze to peddle.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Get it.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
She still loves me.
You'll see.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Black.  Jack.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So that gives you something.
It's not your fault.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
You never told me.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Take the tape to the cops.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
No, sir.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Winona.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Not as much as you'd think.
You know, you ever think about other women?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
What about his killer?
What?
From the grave?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
Go ahead.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Collected shoes too?
I was looking for a pattern.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
Not especially.
They're all criminals?
"Gone live?"
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Huh?
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Oh.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
I'm going to Amarillo.
Sit back.
The little piggie speaks.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
You knew it was me all along?
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[What does the file say?]
Shuddup.
Shut up.
What kind of car do you drive?
You're a comedian?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
Yeah.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Oh. You know.
...and even then...
...then ask where you met her...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Did you get it?
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
I'm a comedian.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Six years.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Are you on the other line?
...Six months.
What kind of things?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
It's a gig.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I just tested for one...
Well, let's hit that party.
It's unbelievable.
Well, you're doing so well...
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Make someone bleed.
So, what? Eleven?
He's trying to be an actor.
...He's derivative...
...People get carjacked...
What are they doing here?
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
I'm not going to Vegas.
Whu?
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
How?
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
What?!?
This version doesn't have fighting?
What? That was the best part of the old game.
What a surprise.
Chelios to Roenick...!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...How novel.
...It's on.
No.
What was cold about it?
You think?
...double diamond...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...just be smart about it.
Six.
You have to answer for Santino.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Are you worried about security for your million?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
You understand him better than anyone.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
Should I bring him in.
Barzini.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For killing a man.
Then why have I become a man like you?
How?
How do you know I come from America?
Shhhhh.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
Mike!
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
We're all tired...
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
Thanks Tom.
They're waiting to see my father.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Goodbye.
Let HER ask.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Just be patient.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Do you recognize my voice?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, darling.
I don't like you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
What?
I love jazz.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
No!
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Relax.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
I thought you'd missed the train.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Ripley's plans.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
So tell me.
Marge and I are getting married.
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
What are you doing?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I'm sure we've met.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
I hope she never knows.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Ha. Did he say why?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Dickie did it.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
To the manner born.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I'll take them both.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Hello Meredith.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Where have you been since then?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Thanks.
Ten thirty?
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
He says so many fiancées.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I'll fix some drinks.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
What about Thomas Ripley?
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
31 people.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Yes, mam.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I can believe that.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
I know. I could have picked you up.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
Hello, Betsy.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Yeah.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
With who?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Show me how he did that again.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Yeah.
A real skunk.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
You carry a piece? You need one?
That's not hard to do.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You just gonna leave 'em?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
My work may take me out of New York.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Yes I am.
Physical? Criminal?
You moonlightin?
Why do you ask?
Why?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
It happens.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You know how I feel about what you do.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a fool, Billy.
I am, too.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Well...
How'd they get it inside?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
I'm not refuting anything.
I do.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
By all means.
Shhhhhh.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Good to meet you.  Again.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Can't wait.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
Dad, I...
Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
We live in a theater?
Who the hell is this "they?"
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
No thanks.
When was that?
No, I...
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Yes.  Very.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Yes.
Lovebirds.
Yes?
Yes.
I suspected as much.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Look.
Just listen to them!
If your father were here...
Your brother told me.
I don't know yet.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yes?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Impossible.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
I got them all, Mother.
Shhh. Shhh.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Oh, thank you.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Not by the thousands.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
That's all right.
Monday?
What?
Lovebirds.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
Are they moulting now?
Ahhh, but I know you.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
How do you know Annie?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
You are, aren't you?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Oh. That. Rome.
I wrote the letter.
Why?
It is for me.
Like what?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Are you staying?
Take wing!
No... wait.  Hold me.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Well, all right, but...
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I'm not sure, but...
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Of course.
Can't you please finish your drink?
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Aye.
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come in, boy -- come in.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I remember her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Gray killed her.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You've no thought of going there?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Not yet.
He was a nice horse.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
Yes, Doctor.
Three years.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
He must leave me alone.
I'm looking for my friends.
Tell her... we'll get him.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
I don't know you, man.
The scar.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's not. I can't take it.
Yeah, we do.
You killed my daughter.
Just hold on to me.
Honey. I just can't.
Watch out!
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
I don't believe you.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
He'll be there at 8:30.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Okay.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Why not, Bobby?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
What about him?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I feel different right now.
Jittery is the word.
Naturally I think so.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Yes--?
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
Remember those words.
I -- I thought you were--
You don't.
They would have killed this man?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
Can't stand light?
We don't ride with vampires.
El Vampiro.
Maximum body-count.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
For a ride.
Yeah.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
I can't do that!
Chill out Edgar.
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
Okay, okay.
Sam, don't --
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
What's that smell?
Soon.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
C'mere, Nanook.
But, Mom...
I hear this is the decade for cute.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Well, I...
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
What would that make Mom?
Nanook...
What about Mom?
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
The Marines.
Just listen.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Ain't it there?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
If it did get to him.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
It's shorted out or something!
Look, I'm just guessing...
But...
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Then we'll never make it.
All in Norwegian.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Damn if I won't.
Little over two hours.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Everything that's been missing.
Who else could have used that key?
MacReady...?
The journey is part of my work.
And everyone looks like us?
What else can they do?
Where?
What happened?
No...
But you're only a mud carrier.
But there's nothing here.
Can you show us where they live?
I'm used to that.
Oh, shut up.
End...?
I won't leave you like this.
I'll never forget this.
I will...
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
What's happening to the moon?!
Hold on... I know I have it...
It's only a machine.
Let them.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
For God's Sake, David --
I live with it every minute of every day.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I would.
His home.
Thank you...
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
More than 800,000 years.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
We share everything.
Thank you.
I can see Kalen's point.
Orion's belt...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Mara --
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
I see.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Why?
New Yorkers.
I suppose so.
We don't know.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Kalen...
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
What about Starks?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
That's too bad.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
No, it hasn't.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Why?
Jackie.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
Yeah.
I know.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I don't know.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
To the hospital.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
You're not crazy.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I did?
What are you talking about?
Don't you go to jail for that?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
Why?
No.
Where are you going?
Sure.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
Sure.
Yup. That's me.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
So you never knew your mother?
What.
Yes, baby?
Well, son, she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
It's him.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
What's wrong?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
You're a little angle, you are.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
Can't it go to any office?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Who is it?
It's nothin' like that.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Which part?
Yes.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Lemme see the map.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
What.
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
You mean now or before?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Gosh.  It sure is.
Well, you got it now.
Just ignore him.
About how fast was I going?
Yeah, you want it?
Are you alright?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Eeuww.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Yup.
What?!
Oh.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Say you're sorry.
Fresno.
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Huh? But why did Healy?
Yeah feels like it.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Mints?
Hm?
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Thanks.
Big time.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Healy, what I just tell you?
No I can't.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Dumbshit.
Ahh.
Nepal? Have you been?
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Same here again.
It's right there on your golf bag.
Some buildings I'm working on.
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
That sounds like fun.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Deco.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Huh... that's strange.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You don't buy what?
No.
No.
You can't be serious.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
No, not at all.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
What do you mean 'why'?
Do what?
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Same here.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
I never said that.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Hm?
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Puffy, get over here.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
Yeah?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
All right, let's go.
Toy poodle!
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Shhhhhh!
What do you mean?
So what's up?
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Huh...?
Bye, Ted.
What --
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Yes.
Where the hell are you?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
What does the letter say?
Kenny. It's over.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
Still heading for Cuba.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
He was.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Dean Rusk!
No you weren't.
Not as far as the election goes.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
I don't know. I don't know.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Jesus Christ...
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Hey. Nice tie.
You're my hero, Carl.
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Oh, yeah -- right.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
Good. Thank you.
Goodbye.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Jesus...
Who the fuck is he?
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Good.
How'd you know?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Yes.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You're steppin' on sign.
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Let's go.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
A what?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Likewise.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
What do you mean?
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
That's all!
Where were you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Two miles.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
You're an animal.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Winston Churchill.
Why?
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Do what, show you a good time?
That's what I want.
It does.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Take something off.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Well what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
What is he doing?
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
BREAKING LEFT!
Okay.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Just relax.
But I have to!
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Who's your pilot?
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Come on, relax...
What?
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
Was.
GOT 'EM.
SHIT!!
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
We did it.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
Three guesses.
Sir?
The wings..
Yes sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I don't know...
What was that?  An accident?
The Last Resort.
And you get a kickback.
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
That's right.
It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Where's Kuato?
You tell me.
Oh, Rekall.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Harry!
You went to Rekall, remember?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Up to the right.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
What is it?
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Up!
Come on!
Mmmm.....
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Yeah, sweetheart?
I'm late.
Bye.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Beats me.  I just work here.
Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
You can't fight'em that way...
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
You're hung up again.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
You got <u>that</u> right!
Little sons of bitches.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Me, too.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Like hell you are.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You are so full of shit...
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
LET'S DO IT!
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
It most certainly is.
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- The Nazi he knifed?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
1530 Rivington Street.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Right.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
EXACTLY!
I don't need sleep!
That's right.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Don Reynard.
This and that.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Thank you, Carl.
I am going over here.
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
Yep, it sure is.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Teresa Banks.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
No, sir, we did not.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
What do you mean?
Shorthand. Really?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
I don't know, Sam.
Oh.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
Faulty wiring.
You didn't do your homework?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Well, why not?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Donna, you are a muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Nothing.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Cause I like it.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Hey, Jacques...
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You know it and I know it.
You mean the ones you pity.
Boating?
Hiking?
Sex?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
It's a school night... back by nine.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Yes.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
It's a crime.
I...
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
I thought I would need it.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
I'm just an M.D.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
I was her doctor.
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That's right.
...We did everything we could...
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Yes. I wrote it.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
Yes.
Why is that?
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
And what are you? A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Maybe what?
You're talking like a drunk.
I...
You, you don't under...
No.
How come you're calling me from...?
And ask me what?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...I'm sure you do...
...I understand...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
Yeah.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
What do you want?
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Oh shit, what's today?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
I don't want a mistrial.
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Huh. And why is that?
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
Yes.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
But I think I know where she'll be....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
It was nearer than that.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
D.O. to number three..come in.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
You get any sleep last night?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
What?  What kind of episode?
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
I like this story.
Not sleepy.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Coming for you...
A story?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Yeah, sure.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Yep.
You miss him.
He knows.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Yes sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
No, I can't.
What?
You're not a moron.
I know.
What was that?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
Like this!
I can't watch this.
Fine.
What are you talking about.
Sir...?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
I know.
Why are you here?
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
You're officer of the watch, George.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
You know what he is talking about here?
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
I'm not staying out here.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
It wasn't hard.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Artie? That you, Artie?
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
Why? He's right in the groove.
How old are you?
Well... Yeah - okay.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
What's that?
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
No... She's fine. Back home.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Sailor... Lula loves you.
How's that?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Didn't he say somethin'?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
You up for that?
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
What kinda trash talk is that?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
I'm goin'.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
One bad car accident...
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
No radio or TV...
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
What makes sense, is all.
SAILOR!!!!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Got any plans?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos... It isn't.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Santos...
Shoot him.
No... But...
What?
So?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
You heard right.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
He's right, you look horrible.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's a transvestite.
Isn't she?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Because... because...
Tripp.
Hit your brakes.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Shit.
Only in your bones?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Ye-es?
So what's the problem?
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
That was MacCaulay.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
It's mine.
How long have you been having them?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
A little.
I'll miss my bus.
That's really it.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
Yea, James.
You're welcome.
Sure.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Hm.
Maybe...
Jesus, James. Wow.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
How can you tell?
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Ah, wear whatever you want.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Oh. Well. I...
Who does?
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
It beats 'What's your major?'
Chancellor.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
You got me.
About the baby.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Would Walter really press charges?
I think I might have.
And you're old.
I know, but sometimes...
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
James is... I don't know...
I'm not sure that's possible.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Yes?
It's Grady, Walter.
I... I...
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Just a few then. The big ones.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
It wasn't like that.
You don't have to tell me this.
I mean... feelings.
Why not?
I can't.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Not yet.
It's my bird book.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
Cop.
They grow outside, don't they?
Woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
Know what?
'Fraid not.
I'm adjusting okay.
It gives me headaches.
What?
Why's that?
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Lovers' quarrel?
How come?
Yes?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
I know because... it's just something I know.
Robin, listen to me.
Yes?
Can't I stay a little longer?
The job's okay.
No fucking way.
It's okay.
Have to talk about something.
I'm not that crazy.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
They usually tell me.
What is your idea of being normal?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
What did you want to happen?
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
What?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
In my bed too.
This is garbage!
Yes.
Accept you?
Time.
What picture?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
I'll buy a plant.
Sorry.
Not tonight.
You're still here.
The morning?
Because I like you.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Nothing. It's over.
What?
Which brother did this?
No you don't.
I'm not scared.
Maybe you should be.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
No way that could just be seawater.
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
What do you think he saw?
Cute, Virgil.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
They'll come out after us.
Calm down, Bud.
God, I hate that bitch.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Give me that!!
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
How many are there?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
But you just said that a month was too...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
And how do you explain that?
Yes.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
And what about you?
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
And why did you drop them?
What! Get married?
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Nothing.
Why?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
To do what?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But why all nudes?
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
What do you think?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
We'll try again.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Who?
Why?
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes...
Oh my dear child.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
I don't know... I don't know...
Love.
Right now?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Would you like to talk about it?
And what did you do?
Not at the moment, no.
I can't have them any more.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Somebody told her.
Yes.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Not my fault.
Everything... I don't have children.
I'm not sick.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
To help me.
Yes.
Because I wasn't worthy.
May I open my eyes now?
It grew.
Yes.
No.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Someone's following me.
What do you feel?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Frightened.
Yes.
Yes.
Agnes... Agnes...
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Marty, what are you doing here?
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
If I find anything I'll call you.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
When?
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
How do you survive?
Uh huh.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Who told you this?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
None as far as I know.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
What's your opinion?
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
So, someone else could have done it.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Nothing.
Yes.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
About what?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I knew that after the fact.
Don't deny it!
The woman's health is at stake.
All right?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Hand rolled.
Right...
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who is he?
She is an innocent.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
She didn't want any help.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Are you now?
I'm a deserter, too.
Yeah.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
They'll be here.
I'll have a bash.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Wake up!
You crawler.
We do.
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
Something like that.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Out where?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
What's that mean?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What?
Is there a fire, then?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
You see, sly villains.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Shall I?
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You needn't bother.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
We were going to do it.
Come on speedy!
Sit down, the lot of you.
You wouldn't!
Oink! Oink!
Now, look here, Norm ...
Oh yes.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
He'll get over it.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Nerves.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
And they want me?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Is that you, Roby?
Yeah, it's you all right.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah.  Two hours.
I'll see what I can do.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
No, you'll follow me.
Take a look.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
What?  <u>Why</u>?
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Right.  Talk to you.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
The water will still recycle.
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
Poison gas...
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Still unconscious?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
Hey!  what about the film?
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Is it armed?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
<u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Yeah?
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Even simple.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
By eating our food supplies.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Yeah... I forgot.
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Sure.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Yeah...
Thanks.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Do it.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Yeah?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What?
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
Yeah, I got it.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
How?
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Thanks.
Auto-shop?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Well... try the headset.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Real man' drink.
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Agreed.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
It wasn't meant to be.
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
You can have one at Max's.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
That's how you met me. In passing.
Hear, hear...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Frankly, I don't remember.
Huh?
Where?
That's nice.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Huh?
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
When - when are you coming back?
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
- guilty.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
I'm trying terribly hard.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
Hear, hear...
Glory Hallelujah.
Groom.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
Is it the money?
It's only one picture deal.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Everything.
But she just got here...
What did you expect - live sables?
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Don't be dense. The party.
Miss Harrington...
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
What for?
Probably not.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You rest. I'll get it...
He's the best.
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Try...
It couldn't possibly interest you.
I'd like that.
I won't forget.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
I don't intend to be.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
- an understudy's performance.
I'll never get over it.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I wouldn't like.
Really, Eve? Why?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Three or four miles...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Well... all right.
Check.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
What is?
Well. We've spent weekends before with nobody talking...  ... just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
That was a pity...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Nothing much. She apologized.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
I will.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
She was a revelation...
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Go ahead, please...
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
All you got to do is name it.
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--mine's better--
The fucking New York Times.
--you do?--with access to records?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
Sure.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--I haven't said anything--
How high up, which Republicans?
--'cause I only know four chords--
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
--Teddy Kennedy?
You can't.
I know where Dwight works.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--so?
--that was awhile ago--
--there's nothing new in it--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Give me your checkbook then.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
Which people?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I will not talk about the other two.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
Electronic surveillance.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Haldeman too?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Security consultant.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
The C.I.A.
--I'm Woodward.
I couldn't say.
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
I did all right on McCord.
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--well, Sloan--
Could develop.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--go over your sources again--
Haldeman.  Right?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
No, none of those.
The what to what?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Pardon me?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Neither will I.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Because I want to.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
What?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
I don't get it, that really works?
I do, baby, I do.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
You fuckin' rule!
Yeah.
These are for you.  From father to son.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
After getting laid?
Okay.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Kevin, this is serious!
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Okay.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Dude, he does not.
Shut the fuck up.
Keep it down, dude.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Doing what?
No way.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
AHHHHHHH!
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I know. He told me.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Yeah. French fries...
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
Really.
What?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
Andy...
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
You on drugs? Huh?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
I have my reasons.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Now just get off the train.
You shouldn't have pushed us!
I'm glad you	did too.
Anya... where are we?
Is it? Is this what you want?
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Ah! Let us begin!
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
It worked in Odessa...
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Tsch.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Wisconsin.
Well, where is it? I-
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Yeah!
What?
Okay.
Yeah.
As Balzac said...
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Yeah.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Oh. What?
Yeah?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh! My God! 
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Yeah.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Commentary.
You have a raccoon?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Key word here is "indulgent."
It's a narrow view.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Hey.
You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Oh, Jesus.
M'hm.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
Yeah. Right.
We're gonna operate together.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
We really had a good time.
Oh, yes, yes.
No.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Oh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
A long time.
Oh yes.
Why didn't you come in?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
Why last?
And how's the diva doing?
Leo?
October-ish.
To dander.  Otis.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
Why would she care?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
And you're not the wife.
Count on it.
You really need to be fucked.
She's in ICU.
She left a note.
Forget it, Judy.
Let me heal you, baby.
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
Fantastic.  Out here.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Beats a lawsuit.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Through the sweats or not?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Really?
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
You're not ready.
Okay.
Me too.
Ah...
Oh, you know, I am.
Come on, Panes...
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ah there's our snookums now.
Very well put.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I'll be your best friend.
I will treasure this.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
That's a lot of those.
How long have you been married?
Clair is a hovering mother.
Trust him.
Well...wow...
Not good.
He always has two or three going...
Let's just go home, okay?
Sally?
How long ago was it?
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
Yes.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Very.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Yes.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Well...  I declared war!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<u>What</u>?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
And do Princesses do improper things?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Outstanding.  Princess...?
No, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
So...you two are in love?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Yeah.  How much?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Care to make a small wager?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Really?
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How come?
Of course not.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Let me help you.
Two o'clock.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
In his apartment.
As soon as I can walk.
No -- it's my stomach.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
I'm not very good at it.
You don't have to entertain me.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I don't want to talk to him.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
I guess so.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
No, I don't.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No -- just come as you are.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
What?
Oh.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
I'm fine.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Seven --  -- queen.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Gas?
I don't know.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Now will you get out?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Aren't you?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Well, I have things to do --
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
The party's over.
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Come on, Fran.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
You know I liked it better long.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
Are you sure that's what you want?
I promise.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Yeah, we better.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Don't you ever stop talking?
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Lovely. You were a big help.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
It won't happen again.
See if they'll what?
Yeah.
Well --
We need all our fuel.
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Let's talk about you.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
Cook school -- that did it.
I don't know.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Let's go.
Where ?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
What is it?
Looks pretty shallow.
Too far inland.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Ours.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Charlie?
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Your daughter.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
I got bored in Saigon.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Hairy ?
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
I'm Kurtz.
What do you mean, Colonel?
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
I can handle it.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
Sure.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
That's me.
Why did they attack us?
You're Australian?
No. Not really.
What things?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Right now -- I am.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Back against the bars.  Now.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Yeah?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
You don't know how true that is.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Any idea who could've done it?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Since forever.
Yes.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
What's with the dark?
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
How ya doing?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Yes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I want you to go on this trip.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Welcome.
No.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
It's one idea...
Yeah... Well...
Go ahead.
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
I'll take care of myself --
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Two years ago...
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Well, I can't reach them.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
'Love was... '
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Oh, my gosh.
This stuff is pointless.
Melvin...
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where?
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
Tachlinkov.
I ain't scared of you.
That's right.
What?
Why don't you tell me.
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
You're too late.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Yes, sir.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Robert?  Robert?
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Yes.
We don't have a choice.
Right.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
How did you get into the business?
You were like a boy genius?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
Thinking.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Yes.
Okay.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Okay.  Then what?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Except --
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.  Here I am again.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
No.
And you were drilling these holes...?
What?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
I'm sure you will.
Okay.
Yes.
Electra --
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Honesty.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
I hope not.
Average.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
Thank you.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
What's that? Free!
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
An alternative literary venue!
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
We could make a run for it?
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
No, for the Asylum.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Who put a bee up your butt?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
I fell in love.
It just happened.
She's cool.
What are you on about?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
You capitalist pig!
He's lying! I am.
Tell me some bad news?
Lucky break!
Did you see anything in the files?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Good, what's his number?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Some deal you did there!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
No, by road?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Yes.
Yes.
You used to read.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
What?
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
No.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
No, it should be over soon.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Cool!
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Working....Under cover.
Can we talk in your office?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
And I have no idea why.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
That's over. Way over.
Thanks.
Me neither.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Scamming's a strong word.
-- Obviously.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Don't bother!
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
Don't you?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
We're doing something -- ?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Where?
What would you do up here?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Where's the one you're building?
Mars.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Sure.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
That I want you to take me home.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Dad --
No. I want what's best for you.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Lead man.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
She did. It was you.
I'm no dummy.
Please.
For pay?
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
Scalene?
Uh, yes, sir...
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
No!
How are you?
What drill?
Not now....
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What year?
Oh, right, right... 
Precisely! 
A mall?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
What if you lost your keys?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
What do you call this? 
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
Dick? Dick who?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
They come with the house.
She plays the clarinet, too.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
They're okay.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Sure.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Great.
I don't know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
What?
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
He was nervous.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't want a steak.
Excuse me.
Positive?
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
I just don't want to go.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Just gimme a chance.
Hold it right there.
Beats me.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Where's the professor?
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Go where?  Where're you going?
It's too dangerous.
A what?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Why me?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
...I know this must look... funny.
Really?...
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Stop it, Bill!
I...
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Well... actually, no Bill...
And what would that be, son?
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Who?
To do what?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Where there's life there's hope.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
You gotta believe me –
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
The others are being sent.
Uh-huh.
Nine days – Tuesday –
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Anyway.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Home. Watching TV.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
No.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
What?
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Yes.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I don't smoke.
I quit.
I have nothing to hide.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
That's right.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No, thanks.
Didn't you study it in school?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
No.
Make love to me.
I found Lisa Henderson.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What happens to them?
Somebody has to die.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Yes I am.
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I hope I helped you out.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Why the hell not?
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
I don't believe it.
Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
I'm going with you.
What was it?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Fuck you, too Nick.
It was an accident.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Can there be some mistake?
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
Ignorant art?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
That's good. At least they're interested.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
Annina Nosei.
How about right now?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Sure, ok..
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
I'm here.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Very well.
Still not here.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
So then what?
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
Good. What do you have?
I guess it was a long time ago.
I guess you did.
What who's saying?
How is he?
What's that about?
George?
You only want one Big Mac?
Yeah, it's the best one.
Stand still.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
A what?
Yeah.
I need this?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Hanging on every word.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Have we?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Treat to be here.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yeah?  Me too...
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Your blood, Max.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
One way to find out?
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Too good?
Actually, it's a lot like that.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Thanks.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
I recognized the accent.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid to ask.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Surf's up.
Can he save her?
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
But he's never said a word-
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You lie!
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
My life's an open book. You read?
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Banzai.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
What?
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
And now....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
I'm not-
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't want to remember!
Excuse me.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Who is it?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
I got family. ...Please.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
... Murderer...
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
As far as I know.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
I feel naked without it.
... Where are you calling from?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
Take 'em! I want his head!
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
What were you thinking?
Allie, he's not.
It's gone.
Yeah. Deja vu.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Meaning?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Excuse me.
Ahm.....
Yes, isn't he.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I beg your pardon?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Quite right, sir.
Certainly is.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Sure did.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Nope.
Of course he is.
No it wasn't!
What's your problem Beavis?
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
My butt's bothering me!
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
You mean there's mre than one?
Heh hmm heh heh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Oh, that's nice.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Where are his pants?
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
Won't?  Or can't?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
That's all we need.
Wait.
Who did the sushi?
Little black party dresses?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Now, let's get rolling!
No.  What's wrong?
<u>Out</u>.
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
No.  You don't want his help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
And live in what, our station wagon?
Where'd they go?
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?

Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Yes. I think so, too.
Oh, fine.
Thank you.
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
I have no idea...
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes. I lost my remote control.
I like to watch. This is fine.
I am a very good gardener.
Hello, Eve.
Fine. He's very nice.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Our greenhouse.
So am I, Eve.
How is Ben feeling?
No, thank you.
I see.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I see.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
Yes. That is correct.
A flower...
I like to watch.
I can't write.
I can't read.
Yes. I like to watch.
Oh. Thank you.
I never needed money.
Good day, Sally.
Yes.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
I see.
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes.
You're welcome.
Yes.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes, I will.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Try again.
I said - try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Hello, Sophie.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Right, Chief.
No, sir.
Right, Chief.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Thank you, Colonel.
It's that serious, huh?
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Please, have a seat.
Hmmm.
The ferret?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
We'll talk about it in the car.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
You've always loved the animals.
Yes.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
You bastard.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
What's that?
The iguana?
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
Schwartz.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
What's he been in?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
My God.
You're evil, Maxine.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Think, Jew florist?
Says who?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
One hour.
Did you see the reviews?
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Great then.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You mean with Malkovich?
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Well what?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
You remember Halle.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Don't pay to complain.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
May I come in?
Yes ma'am..
Well, what can you do?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Just me.
No use thinking these things now.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Yes sir.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Huh.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Yeah, it sucks.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
That is for the urn.
Yeah, but we're--
My rug.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Huh?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Uh-huh.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
Nancy's pretty good.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
And what do you do, sir?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
You're not interested in sex?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll--
Easy, Dude.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?
You know this!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Come on, Walter!.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Dude.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Fry 'em.
I don't think so.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Then who does he work for?
Not alone.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Us?  What are you talking about?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You're wrong.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You're blind --
Who is LaMagra?
I'm sorry, I --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
He didn't. Get over it.
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
Some kind of archive --
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Deacon brought me back.
What about the chemistry panel?
Sometimes --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
He killed them?
I'll take my chances.
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Yes.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
Oh, sorry, right.
I haven't killed any--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
What is <u>this</u>?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
Sleep.
--you should get back into bed.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
The, uh, blur there.
You have to go.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
I do.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Butt-ugly owl.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
Don't have one.
--I saw what I saw.
--Domini!
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
No one ever comes here.
Anna's the witch.
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
Fine.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
--now there.
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
--oh, Jesus--
I can't!
Ancient runes--
--and we brought it back with us!
--no.
Still working on it.
What?
It touched me, don't you see it now?
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
What happened to my Dad??
No, I--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Sort of...
See a guy.
I just gotta see a guy.
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Abby... you all right?
You're bad.
Marty.
In the trunk.
Thanks.
I don't follow baseball.
I own the place.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...Hell.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
Of course.
Right. Sorry.
What's the point?
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Meurice...
For what?
What?
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yes?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
Nobody.
Never before this.
No.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
Yes, I like you.
What?
Don't say that.
Frank? .can you stand up?
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Frank is coming?
Frank would open you.
Sometimes I think I do.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No thanks. what does that mean?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
That sounds good.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
... You look beautiful.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
Be right down.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
What is?
You happy, baby?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
You're a fucking amateur!
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Good night.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
No more brothers, Diego.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Un sapo?
Yes, it is.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Dad.
What about him?
Figured what out?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
She did that before.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
I'll be here.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Okay, George.
Who's the co-pilot?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
And here?
I understand. What's your question?
Sid Ahmed.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Sure ...
Here?
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Why?
Good evening, sir.
How can I give you this statement?
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
It could've happened to anyone.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
What'd he die of?
The official cause?
But there's more?
Yes.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No -- never.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
You may call your next witness.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
You get his statement?
No.
I had some papers to pick up.
I assume his girlfriend.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Six years.
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yeah.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
We were lovers.
For about one year.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
Cocaine.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No -- she asked me about cocaine.
No further questions.
That's all Dr. Paley.
You called him?
No.  No, I don't.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
We dated for about a month last year.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
No.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Yes.
A.M -- or P.M.?
No.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
You still haven't answered my question.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yeah.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
Of course.
Honey.
No -- you're not.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
How often do you use cocaine?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Talk to me.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Why are there two deeds here?
I said NO!
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
He's not coming.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
They got heat in Michigan.
I'll get right on it.
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
Hmm-mmm.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Want another cigarette?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Oh. How old?
And clean.
But I... We don't even know each other.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You get used to it.
You want to go back in?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Yes.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Why?
I sat outside and had coffee.
What?
Long day. Go to sleep.
What?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
What about us? What about me?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
What happened?
I don't remember!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
So what the hell's the good news?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Just some flies.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Go for it.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
What?
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
Then fuck it!!!
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Fuck it.  Alright.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You were just a kid.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Daddy?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
But --
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Evidence of what?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
All right!  Where's the key?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
I can't.  I can't.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What are you going to do with it?
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
But you know he did it.
All right, Caesar.
No.
This is insane!
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
We're going to need some time.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
I had to.  You made me.
Shut up!
Good boy.
They were in a car accident.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
It's all right, sir.
Oh, right.
Good idea.
Are you okay, Violet?
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What the fuck was it?
What about that guy this morning?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
He was in love with you, right?
What choice?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
Is that what you think?
To let it dry.
Does the case lock?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
What happened?
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I'm still here.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
You're asking me a direct question?
I thought you were never going to do that.
What do you want to do?
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...they won't let you go...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Yes, I'm here...
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?

-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
You could do that?
What?

If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
This your store?
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
What's that?
-- he accessed the account --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
<u>Where am I</u>?
How did I get here?
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't know.
I fixed it myself.
...ditioning.
... have a look.
Got there!
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... new washer.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Er, I knew you looked different.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Ah ...
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
How do you mean?
You killed him?
I'm sure you have
What has Tuttle done?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack ...
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Who are you?
No.
It's my fucking life.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
Looking for you.
Really.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
What?
Who will?
Stop it ... damn you!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Are you still following me?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Don't do anything silly.
It's not our mistake!
Really.
What a BITCH!
The refund for Tuttle!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
This is your dream girl, is it?
You haven't switched it on.
I'm sorry but ...
Actually, I've decided ...
Um ...
I know, I know ...!
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
What? Who is this?
No, sir.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Fixed?
Fixed itself.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
You can trust me on this one.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
We are virgins.
Mary ...
Stressed? He's psycho.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
What did you say?
Yeah?
I guess there's always a chance.
Yes.
Our Lady of Misery.
No.
She should go home.
You look so different.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
He's better, though, right?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
You asked me not to come.
I need to sit down a minute.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Thanks.
What look?
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I never felt better in my life.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Frank!
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Relax, will you.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
What's wrong with it?
Why?  What did they do to you?
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
As good as humanly possible.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
I'm not kidding.
No!!!!!
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Speaking.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
What is she shooting?
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
I'll speak to you soon
I'll never tell.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
We could...
He said something about...
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
No.  Not even you.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes, sure.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Yes.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Good.  That's it...See you.
Uh-uh.
Great.
Well...
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Then you should stay here.
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
Right back to you.
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home!
What, right now?
I already told you I'm not.
You're breaking my concentration!
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Me too.
It wasn't easy.
Now you're a professional!
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Hm...
That means you like me!
What are you trying to say?
Why not?!
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
Is it?  I've forgotten.
Hm.
I'm honored to know this man.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Leonard, what are you doing?
Don't ask.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
I do the research.
I know.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Yeah, right outside the door!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
Have a seat -
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
No...look I'm busy...
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Huh?!!!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Hiya Maxwell.
Why not?
What do you get?
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
Then let me give you something then...
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
We hate you guys!
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
You look like shit, Benny.
I mean it.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
Yeah?
Maybe.
I do?  I guess I do.
'Bye.
I thought we were meeting here.
No...
I am so sure.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
I'm going to the senior dance.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Why don't we see a movie?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
I forgot.
Get out of my facial.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait!
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Our purposes.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh.  Good.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Cassandra's really smart.
Thanks.
Nicole...
Hi.
Jeffrey!
Well, I hope so.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Oh, please.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
I don't think so.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Switch nostrils?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
No, no, it was great.
What a nasty thing to say.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
You got me all confused.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Who?
What's so great about baseball?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
I can do that, too.
What's it say?
Ninety-five miles an hour...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
Oh let's not...
Who's he play for?
We gonna fuck or what?
You spit on me!
How?
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
I won't have to.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Jesus.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Then go.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
My right.
What?
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Love to--
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
We'll be praying for you.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Looking for Crash Davis.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Yes, you were.
Philip, if you would rise.
But what happens when they do find out?
What do you propose?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Hold on a second.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Well...
Okay.
I don't know.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
Eight.
Four aces, Doc.
No.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Nope, there's no way.
In so many words, yes.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
She came to talk to me...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Meet me at three.
Why?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
What are you -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Sammy.
Yeah, she's here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
How do you do?
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Seven o'clock.
Good to meet you.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
No, Ace.
See you, Ginger.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm not crying. 
Yeah.
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
What? What?!
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
What do you mean?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What's it...
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Get out of here!
And where'd you go?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Who were you with?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I should have -
You fuckin' whore!
You understand? What? Let you go?
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
Eight children! 
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Mm.
Mm.
Yeah?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Shut your mouth!
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I've been busy. 
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Okay.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now move along.
Is that the last one?
Yeah. Fuck him.
Carmine's gone.
Carmine left?
How are you?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Mm.
All right.
Yeah.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
Is that what you want?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
What about my money?
But I saw something...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost?
Okay?
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
No, Lester.
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Okay, then.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
All right.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
All right.
Two.
Why?
She asleep?
Remo.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
It's up to you.
So are we.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
No, no, no, no!
Charlie M.
Hey.
You sure?
Yeah.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
I'm sorry.
Having a good time?
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
In women?
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
I wonder..
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What did you think?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
I lied.
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Winning.
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I got her...
Absolutely.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
You've seen me...
You can't get away with..
Men, huh?
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
What's the good news?
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Uh. "Thanks?"
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Not too cool...
But I'm blind.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
Don't you have children?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Then whose is it?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Or relieve me of it later.
Can you make him stop!
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
You don't understand.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
You won't disconnect.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
What are you doing now?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I'm trying to.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
Put the man back on.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
I can't do it.
There isn't any such person.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Stop talking like that!
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
259-7881.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Why are we stopping?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
We don't see you.
Talk to the man.
My pleasure --
I won't let 'em.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
So who's he?
Did he?
What would you call it?
What do you think his name is?
I would expect he does.
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Not in my experience.
Bloody right I do...
Guy I work with.
No.
Scottish?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Must be in love to manage that.
Tell me about him.
What do you think?
I am.
Want to look after you.
Dil --
What you doing here?
Ask to meet me again.
I'm not sure.
No. Sit down.
It's a secret.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. What you doing?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
No! I'm going home...
My pills...
Don't go like that.
In a manner of speaking.
More what?
I like you, DIl
Yes.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's wise, Tommy.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Someone's got to do it.
Leave me alone, Jude.
What do you mean?
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Was I?
You may be right.
Yes?
I take pride in my work.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Thanks.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
Am I?
No. It's the truth.
So I've noticed.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
I didn't even fancy her.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
I'll bear that in mind.
My pleasure, Jody
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Having a pint in the Rock.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
Stop it --
Yeah?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Stop that talk now --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
You won't run.
Got to catch me first --
You didn't?
Tell me, Jody
Nice lady.
No, we are.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
I love you, Adam.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Can you remember anything at all?
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
But I don't have it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Were you followed?
Who?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Oh. Then who's this one?
Me? Why me?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Then who does?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Alexander.
Yes, but we're divorced.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
There, you said it.
Cutting it out.
Oh. 
That sounds like their problem.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I don't believe it.
Well!
Go on.
What do you mean?
You mean, you're a thief?
How much is it worth?
Here's ten.
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
The kid said --
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
But his mother --
I don't know.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
How do you know?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
Where?
The man you had the fight with.
Please stop -- please!
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
How can you tell?
What?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
We want that money -- now!
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
No.
That's impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
How much further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
What are you doing here?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Why?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Why?
Did Sharon say no?
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Attacked how?
You didn't believe her?
Why not?
Just thinking about something.
Hi Sandy.
Ok.
Told you to hide it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
If sheep don't count.
Okay, okay.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
...shit.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Oh...
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

...-tana.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
You want cash?
No.
I need your truck!
I'm gonna stomp your a--
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Oh, man.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Borrowed.
I did not steal this truck!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
Fine. 
God-...


Doesn't work.
Kiss my ass!
Well, then, that means it's call...
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Goddamn!
...Pete!  Come on.

 Oh...
 ...shit!

Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.
What?
Oh, no!
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Worth a try.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...-tion?
...stole the truck.
...piece of shit was worth.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
So I took his truck, yeah.
You know.
We were nationally  ranked.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
...hospital.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Bring him down!
You all right?


We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.
...they come!
...our ass!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
I'm gonna kill him.
 
What?

We got-...
 There's gotta be...
Let's go!
Why'd you stay behind?!


Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
Thank you.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
You-You can't let him...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...
...including the permanently extreme.

Is it--?
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
Let's proceed.
Grateful?
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Almost quaint.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
EXT. FORT LEAVENWORTH - TEN YEARS LATER - DAY.

...-ty.
...scientists.
...time to time, yeah.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
I don't know what the hell...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...-spite the mouth.


Kabula's out.

INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
All right, let's move...
Get ready to take it out!
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
He's brains without ambition...
 No...
...that the prey can bite back.
...-son.
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
...seriously.
I didn't sell the boy any...
You redneck idiot, do you have...
...we're all gonna die in this...
The Army, sealin' us in.
I'll lead 'em out.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Row twenty-three, section C.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Thanks.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Yeah.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
How did you find out?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Tell her later.
I don't know...
Plus what I owe you?
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Well you own a lot of land.
How are you, Lou?
Summer colds are the worst.
I get by.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Who?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No.
No?
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
You accusing me of extortion?
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A private investigator?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
But he wasn't killed.
She's cheating on him.
Did you have affairs?
Where you were when your husband died.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Of course I'm sure.
What? What is it?
I gave everybody the night off.
Doing what?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
You saw my fa... father? When?
I am not!
What about?
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
...That's not what I meant.
I want to see her.
No...
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
She's my daughter.
She's my sister and my daughter!
I have to go home and get my things.
With us.
Okay...
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
I think I got something.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Ida Sessions.
Okay.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
I'm sorry, I --
Hope so. He's working for us.
Only when I breathe.
I never was.
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
What about the water?
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
Yes. No.
Yes.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Why? What do you mean?
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
What's she like? What's she like?...
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
We'll talk about that later.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I didn't see that.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
That's a long story.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Yes -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Yes.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Are they standing for me?
Ask them to sit down.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Emily -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
It can wait.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Thanks.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Susan, I really think -
Susan!
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
Don't go, Susan.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Thanks.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
You can't.
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
Yes?
I'd like that.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Look out that window.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
I've got to think of Emily -
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I know you will.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Yes.
That must have been love.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Yes, sir.
Queer?
What did you get?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
You're shittin' me.
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
This? How long have you been smoking?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
How long have you been a smoker?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Can I watch?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
No, this is great.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
You two better quit it.
Dante. You've got a customer.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
What about Sing?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Um... okay.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Just me.
We did.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Are you open?
What's your point?
Oooh! Navy Seals!
Go open the sore.
Why?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
She called you Brad?
Oh, my God.
Oh yeah.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
So?
Wait.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Can we talk about this later?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
All of them.
I know.
I don't back down.
You've got a customer.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Gatorade.
Exactly. They drank it all.
You've had sex with a dead person.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
That's embarrassing?
Bible truth.
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
Yeah, but at what a price.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
I don't want to talk to you.
You want to rent a movie.
If you must.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
Exactly.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I know I'm your hero.
Five hundred dollars.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Because I'm here.
I'm not. She just left.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
I'll read the book.
What are you talking about?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave me alone.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Thanks.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Thirty-fire.
Jesus Christ, what next?
Excuse me?
They are not.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
How do you know that?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
One seventy-nine.
A half hour.
I should start.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I'm trying.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Scumbag. What are you doing?
No way.
Because he's out of shape.
I like the way you think.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Which one?
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
I copy.
So, what do you see?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
There wasn't time for anything else.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
We spent a night there one night...
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
You couldn't.
Why are you yelling?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Flare up of old emotions...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
What are you doing here!?
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Yeah?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
What?
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
I won't do it.  No way.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
How far?
What are you talking about?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
There, what's that place?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
I've been cured.
Good evening.
Try the wine!
No. She's dead!
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
Keeping fit then?
Well, how are you then?
Oh, aye, aye.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You wanna be sick?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
C of E, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
Yes!!!
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
I just say what the other person would say?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Just had one.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
In my office?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
You're kidding me.
Oh, my, yes.
Then let's have it.
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
Federal?
Twenty five?
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Try?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
Who is this?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
You always stutter?
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What?
Play music.
Believe it.
I need the job.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
What difference does it make?
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I don't get it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Why?
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Some living.
One more.
You're full of shit.
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
None of your business.
Let her go.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mississippi?
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Motive?
I think you're different.
No.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
As opposed to?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Nothing is easy.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Surprise me.
I've been reading up on it.
Can you prove any of this?
Never heard of him.
How'd he die?
Not this again.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Realized what?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
What?
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
What's in Connecticut?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill him?
Where were you the day he died?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Top pocket...  Go on.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Could you be a little more specific?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You've asked me that one three times.
The truth shall make you free.
Terminal?
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Wait --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
No.  Not yet.
Wasn't my idea.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Where do you think Jerry is?
Ellie?
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Meaning...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
What?  Why?
With me.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
I don't understand.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
It's a civilian facility.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
You want to classify prime numbers?
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Is that your official response?
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
I can't move any smaller.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No.  Please.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
That's my girl...  Lights.
That's my girl.  Done.
It's so... small.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
Peter Valerian.
And?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
It's really happening.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Can you try?
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
You're willing to die for this.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
-- I don't know --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
In other words.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Git movin', I said.
Cut that backsass!
We work down in the ditch?
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
What are you doin' here?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Yeah.
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
Git to work!
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
I'll give you fifty cents.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
I just always did like truck rides.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Like an elephant.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Thass right. Just play it...
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
Forty-five.
Gettin' up, Carr.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
No. No chains either.
Only kidding!
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Andy?
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
But </u>alive</u>!
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
When was that?
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
You know I can't do that.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You know where.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You're calling me a crank?
I think this is number three...
Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Nothing.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Then what do you need me for?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
They get fan letters...
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
Let me get a little action started here.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Yes.  I have to go...
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I know, baby.  I know.
What else?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Let's get out of here...
Look at him, grandstanding...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Helen Hudson...
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
It does.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Are we imagining it?
Yes.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
No.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
You could get your wish at any moment.
Yeah, and a dimple.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
And the party?
She said she'd be here at 10.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
A deal's a deal.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
I answered these questions last night.
No.
That must be really difficult.
So are you engaged, or what?
Enough with the abracadabra.
Exactly.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
Really?    Me too.
Tell the doctor.
Michael, I...
Not a one.
Open up.    I want to see.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Thanks.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Congratulations.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Bingo.
And all the plans we have.
Well then why'd it happen?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
You should go.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
You just need to get more organized. L
That's a big question.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
It doesn't matter who.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Sure, I understand.
I'll float you.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Where did they go?
You're calling me on is phone?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
It's Daniel.
No thank you.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Half the tapes.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
-- Did you set it up?
What?
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything?
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
The Holiday Hotel.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Relax. It will be fine.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
It's my idea.
Get in the car.
They sort of got away.
The hell it is.
I know where she went.
Oh, you think?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
What does arresting us get them?
We don't know that for sure.
Tonight.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
Something like that.
No.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
It's for you.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then leave her to me.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I'll never live as a thief!
He is my defeated foe!
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I have a guest.
Really?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
You coward!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
I will.
I left the training early.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Perhaps.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
What about you?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
We must avenge mother!
Father!
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Who ever made that.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Don't thank me.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Murderer.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
Another jolly nickname?
I can see her.
Magic.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Shut up.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
Very well, it's your ass.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Is he inside?
"Our" Crow...?
The night is young.
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
I'll be fine.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
On my mother's life.
Junior.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Why are you being so dramatic?
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Great book.
Thank you.
You implied it.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
No.
Why are you doing this?
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Get off me.
Sure.
Yeah, me neither.
Where did you say she's from?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
No.
I... I don't think you want to know.
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
I don't know.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I do.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Who is this?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Outstanding.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Okay.
Shhh.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
What's your plan of attack?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
She shot you down.
Where'd she go?
Oh yes.
And that's why you're leaving?
I want to fuck.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
It's Cecile.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Excuse me.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Do you know where she is?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Nope.
You're a lucky guy.
How will I get to her?
You bastard!
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
Yes, darling.
Sometimes.
But it's already come true.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
What do you mean?
Well, it seemed to me --
I suppose so.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
I didn't forget.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
They ran away.
It's true.
It was just a voice.
Voices from an old dark house!
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
But there's no one here, darling.
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Your children?
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
But she's such a nice lady.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you read Shakespeare?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Yes, yes -
My daughter died long ago.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Good night...Barbara...
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Your lips look delicious.
What else is there?
Nearly four.
No it's mom.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
No. I don't think so.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
He's been here all night?
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
No.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Check out what I found.
I guess you'll find out.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
So you're Grant's secretary?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
I didn't have to pee then.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
So pee? Here?
You never say that.
On your desk.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Goodnight.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
Interesting possibility.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
You got a dog?
Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
The park dude was missing an arm.
This one walk you home too?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What makes her think that?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
He tried to kill me!
A hunch.  He might be able to...
How could you have been so stupid?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Why are they after you?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What?  Who has?
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Then we must call the police.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Shut up!
Well...
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
They're dead, John.
That's easy.  You...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Great.
... Alright.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Fine...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
... What?
TilT we figure something out.
Yes.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
What about containment, Alan?
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
I don't think so.
Bob...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
The government
I'm not sure.
You could buy it on payments.
So what do we do?
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
I don't think so.
He's not.
Why?
Certainly.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
What?
I can't say.
What about it?
But it's ten-thirty at night.
`Bleed for your king.'
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Mind if I sit down?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
It's just so strange...
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I run a temp agency.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Hi.
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
What is it if it ain't a curse?
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
We got a boat.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
What you wanna do?
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Will do.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Knox?
Knox Overstreet.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
I couldn't stop myself.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
What?
I'm not?
Yes... sir.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
No.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Sort of.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Dead Poets honor.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Don't stop!
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
You have another choice.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Then you can help him.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
But different.
I... I just don't want to come.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
Found what?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
what?
Yes.
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Shut up!
Did you clear this?
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
That's what I do.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
You're saying they can think?
Keep tasting...
Yeah...
You ain't giving the orders here!
So?
Joey...
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Where is everybody?
Maybe plans changed...
Nothing.
John...
I know...
Those are mine!
Damn right!
What?
Good... Pass the beer.
John,we're going huntin'.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
You're full of shit!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
It won't open.
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But you must come in.
Yeah.
Thanks.
You know a guy named Merle?
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman, yes.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Biederman!
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
Would you?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I want to go home, Merle.
This is horrible!
Hunt with Vince?
I'm doing that too.
What do you think?
Forget Sal?
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
You wanna bet?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Then lemme have 'em.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
What?
Listen, Nick --
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Here. Behind you.
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up.
Up.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Put that on your political resume.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
And I want Doucet.
Remember my promise.
Keep 'em busy.
Yes.
But Sergeant...
How do you know?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Pass.
Yes.
Relax, let technology do the work.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Simulated one.
I'm here.
...What are you talking about...?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.
This little thing says I can't.
Of course I will.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
I did not, Grandma.
Howdy, Hank.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, you're not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You are afraid!
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Opportunities?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Never!
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Well, I --
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You want me to go around --
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez!
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Tired?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
Isn't that your own fault?
Jabez!
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
But meant her moving here.
Mind if I play some tunes?
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
What does he want?
And if he alters it...?						*
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Go fuck yourself.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
I'm going to count to three...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Oh...Where does he live?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks.
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
You don't want to know.
I...I shot a kid.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
What about the kids?
Hello, Sonny.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah.  So how are you?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
What?
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Look... who's on the phone?
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Well, then...
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
What do you want to know that for?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
... armed robbery ...
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
I don't fool around with you.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I don't know.
I'll be God damned if you will.
They look like good kids.
I'm sorry.
Would I hire you?
I'm glad it's okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, not until after they killed him.
No, that's all.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
What?
Dead or alive?
What kind of a deal?
Yeah ...
Get over there!
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want them all.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
What can he do, he's clean...
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
Sonny - Here's your document.
Yeah - it looks real official.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
What about your toe?
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Must you use that awful word?
I said stop it.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE ON TELEVISION HERE!
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
I be.  I'm living large.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
And?
You a troublemaker?
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
What?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
You're welcome.
We're still standing.
How old are you?
What makes Sammy run?
What makes Sammy run?
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I'm working.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
What responsibilities?
What are you so worked up about?
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
C Duracell.
Don't worry about it.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Quit bullshitting.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Gotta go.
When?
Your memory is really getting bad.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Then we'll do something else.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, it's not like that.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Later.
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Keep dreaming.
That's right.
We're outta here.
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
I love you, Black.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
I love you.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Tell Pino.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Don't start on me today.
Yeah, I think.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
I'll tell you why!
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
In the new library there.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Come over around seven.
Yeah...
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Probably because we've never met.
Cool.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
You're it.
Oh, is this your special place?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Peg leg?
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
She did not.
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Wanna bet?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
No.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Do you want me to pet your head?
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Do we have a deal?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
And I you.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And...?
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Piter.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
We felt his presence.
Yes?... How was your journey?
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Pain.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Who do I play?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Eddie, you screwed up.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Eddie, how was I?
I don't know.  Where?
Rolling.
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Ed, it was only one review.
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
That's not true --
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
You could say that --
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
Um, I guess --
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
What do you mean?
STOP!
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yes?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
What's uncanny?
I don't know.
What octopus motor?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Mr. Wood!
I'm directing.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
Isn't that the same thing?
Do they show it?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Anything good?
Come on...
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Went --
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Mm...  Oh, man...
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
We're falling behind.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
You batted or you bunted?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Who's in it?
Welcome to work, Ed.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
The what?
I know, I ...
... yeah, then, but...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Somewhere.
Come on...
...yeah?
What?
Everybody's someone.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
It's nice.
You're in show business?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
We're excited.
What?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
It's me, Ed.
Ray, come an--
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No problema.  You want a picture?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Oh, man! So...
Hi.
Thank you.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
What?
Dick.
Yeah?
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Sporty.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Oh.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Sherry... I love you.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
What?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
Yeah, plain scotch.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
So tell me about it.
This business, Captain?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Call me Dudley.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I got to write my report first.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
At least not anymore.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
I don't know him.  Mr...
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Susan Lefferts.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
They shot him in his library.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
White's a mindless thug.
Why?
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Okay.  I'll do it.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
That's right.
What?
You make a mistake?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
What?
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Showbiz.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Yes.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
Who are you calling?!
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Clear as day.
Told by whom?
Who was that other guy?
Wait.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
No shit.
And you won't. Now move--
One-twenty.
You told me no calls.
Why?
That wasn't so hard.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Oh my God.
With what?
Is that good?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
I'll say.
Okay.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
A report?
No.
No, sir.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Just for the criminals.
Something bad happened tonight.
Yeah.
I know.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Yes.
What happened to your head?
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
It's not?
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Yes.
Eat your fish.
You got a minute?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Yeah.
We believe he did.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We'd rather not--
Seat 74.
Merry Christmas, son.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Where's Stacy?
Really?
Dad!
Do I know you?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Usually they take clothes.
Table 122?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Calm down.
Jesus.
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Jerry?
Bobby--
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Yes sir.
Fuck you.
He's clever. He had help.
What's your ETA?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
I don't want to go back.
What do you mean, poetry?
Pardon?
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
What?  No!
No.
This is empty, just coming!
It's a folk song.
Don't do this.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
There you have me.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
You too.  Good luck!
Could I trouble you for some water?
What?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
In my room.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
No.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
I don't know what that means.
Please don't creep around this house.
And you've forgotten yours.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
To arm-twisting.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Because I'm a nurse.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Hey! -
Never heard of it.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I try not to expect you.
I'll always go back to that church.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Does he have to go?
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
How awful.  What will you do?
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
He's on to something bigger.
Too late now.
I'll call an ambulance.
Well, no...but...
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
It's not for sale.
Give him the card.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Got it.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We go underwater?
It was perfect.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
No. It's a down payment.
Let's just see how we do.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
One more item--not on the check list.
It's---beautiful.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Shut up.
Yes. Yes.
Get the hell in.
Everything.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I'd taken the Mask?
And the money goes--
You've thought of everything.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
Packed.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
The disc is still in there.
You can do it.
No way.
What about you?
You gave them the eight billion.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
What do you think?  What's this?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
So you say.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
Right.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Excuse me?
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
And that's what caused the contamination?
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
You didn't care about my case?
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
What?  Who?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Say you were wrong.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Right.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
That's right.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
I don't know.
So did I.
Well I hate it.
I'm gonna go live with George.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
You got more than one?
You got a little girl?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Why not?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
I'm just saying --
Lock the door.
What's that?
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
I will.  Bye.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Have you been logging on?
Yeah.  Who are you?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
We're not out of this yet.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
What is it?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
And what are they, pray tell?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
What was it?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Or you ran into something ....
Probably an asteroid field ....
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
You may call me Leia.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke!
I understand.
What is it?
Oh my, no!
I thought you knew this person.
Why not me?
No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Never.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
I want that ship.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
They look pretty docile.
Please
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Where?
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Not anymore.
Dream on, blue eye.
I don't know yet.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Lock fuel rods.
It's history. I gotta go.
Delgado?
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
If he lets you get close enough.
Looking to get out.
Where?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
Who?
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
Move aside!
So be it, to the death.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
In the great book.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
What is it my child?
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Because you and the land are one.
There is one.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
I'm not jealous!
People make you laugh?
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
I?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I didn't know that.
I see, your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Of course I didn't.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
You're a nice man.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Karl!!
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Please.
In Europe.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Captain Howdy.
Cause I like it.
I wouldn't talk.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Do you not like him like daddy?
So what's next?
I came to say goodbye.
How's the girl?
What's playing.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
You might loosen the straps then.
In here. With us.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
Who are you?
No.
Amen
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Are you a relative?
Why not?
You're not going to drive.
You're not going to drive!
It's all there.  Both nights.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
We have some lotion.
You bring trunks, Jack?
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Two at a time?
Get your hand off me.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Out.
My pleasure.
How we doing?
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Thanks.
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
You'll see.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
It's not family.  It's business.
We don't get a gig.
I don't know what you mean.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I'll drop the eighths.
She'll get here.
How about these?
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Good idea.
Yeah.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
How come I didn't hear anything?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
You always threw up.
You could've come.
I can't make the tenth.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
I don't know.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah.
Well, that's fine --
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Yes, it is.
Impersonally.
Miss --
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What's he talking about?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
They're nines.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Hey!
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Great.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Yes, well, they are.
Uh ... thanks.
I'll call you.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Job.
Funny job.
He doesn't bite.
For a while.  She left.
I suppose.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Nothing personal --
I guess in case one year they're not.
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Huh?
You don't pick your brother.
If I see him.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
What's a prom?
Yeah?
... Thanks.
Drive.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Only one you've never broken.
For what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Is that what you think?
How come?
One last time.  It's important ...
Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Like you know anything about it.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
That's your name, isn't it?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
What happened?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Have fun at work.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Back then -- who wasn't?
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
So you left her?  Just like that?
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
What about me?
What’s going on here?
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
That’s where you work.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
It’s just two kids, right?
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
So could you write down her exact address?
Hey, is that really necessary?
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
No.
I call all you white guys "Jack."
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Uh huh...
Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
Okay, chief.
All in one tape?
For us, Kate.
Because that’s where I live.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
...my feet are hurtin’...
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
Do what?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
If you want to look at it that way...
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
No, open it...
Zeena...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
Okay...
What are you sure about?
That’s all I wanted to hear...
It’s like a museum.
Think bigger.
A perk for what?
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Of course I did.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Merry Christmas...
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Youthful high spirits.
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah, nine years straight.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
Victor did.
That's terrible news...
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Dude.  That's my sister.
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Never better.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Why didn't you say something?
Raising the shields.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
<Me>?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Yes, Cora.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Now I know...
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
But I did. I'm positive!
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
That line was tampered with...
Two in a row?
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Was there any damage?
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
No Jean, no money!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Jezhush.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Yeah, you already said that.
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Uh-huh.
I unnerstand.
White Bear Lake?
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Chaska.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Oh, yah?
Yah, that can happen.
Oh, man!
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Okay.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah.
...Who they playin'?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
...There's a million dollars here!
Call 'em up.
Yah.
Yah.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah?
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
No, no, that's fine.
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
So?
Uh-huh.
Norm?
No.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah, ya think?
Oh, fine.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Congratulations, Jerry.
He's at Norstar.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
We're still men.
Oh.
Look at my face.
Yeah, both of us.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
I'd like to thank the academy...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Should we?
I suppose.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
It suits you.
Here.
Feel anything?
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
I could check your prostate.
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
What is wrong with you?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
What?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
No, supply oxygen?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
This is how we fill up our lives.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Yes, you can.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
No, I'm not...
You quit?
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Imagine how he feels.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
No.
I want to know --
Tyler...
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Nothing.
This isn't possible...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
I'm going to...
Stop finishing...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No!
Yes, it is.
How'd you know?
Please, God, no...
No, please, no, God, no!
How you doing in there, hero?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Random, sure.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
Carter.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Hold on.
I know.  I can feel it too.
No, I'm good.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Sure.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know, Dad.
What feeling?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Who am I, David Blane?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I'm... really sorry.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Thirty-nine.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Design?
No harm. No foul.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Huh?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
Powerful warrior.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Alright.  Home run.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
I suppose you have...
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Christ almighty.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
I could take it or leave it.
Those men are all dead.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
But now it's free, right?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Well, there's nobody special!
Meeting ... people.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Why this is outrageous!...
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
You still believe in God?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
No, it's not... Come here...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
It was a crime.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
How much?
What girl?  I didn't notice.
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
You're totally gone, aren't you?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
Who?
It's a classic.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Who are you talking to Jack?
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
You don't have to say that.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
You have a disease.
Shhh...
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Out where?
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
I'm not.
You'll be gone, period.
Okay...
Fill it up.
Where are you going?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
That's good.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Everybody still up on the Island?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Uhm hmm.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
That's dangerous, you know.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
I didn't have any.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Yeah, I think I could.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I'll be back later...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Yes.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
At game, Carl.
It's all right. I'm fine.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
It's a Borzoi.
I hope I didn't hear that.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
So get the fuck outta here.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
I, umm, came to see you.
I just wanted to see you.
You got a boyfriend?
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
How old is he?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
She didn't say she had no man.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
What?
Jus' from around the way.
Unbelievable.
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Sonofabitch.
They didn't do anything.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Funny old bird.
Just relax....
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Gum thought Brazil.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
You may be right.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Whoops.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Right.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
I'm sorry?
No, thank you.
John Ultrarelamensky.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
Here, take mine.
No. He was. I got him out.
It's amazing.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
But I've seen the deed.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Gail, please.
I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
Bastard.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
What?
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
Why not? Oh shit... really?
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Get out of here.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
Not really?
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Who's your decorator?
Excuse me?
Who?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
But I am...
What did these Vancouver factories do?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
No prob...
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
Johnny's C.D.?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Peachy.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Shock.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Boca?
Doesn't register.
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Encore du sho ping!
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Mmm.
What's he do?
Yeah, I know.
Willie Mays.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Who's on him?
Not a chance.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Drink this.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Give who a tail?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Third time around.
Hiya, Jesus.
What is that old building?
What was it?
You know what I'm saying.
Nothing.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you more.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Do you know where I found this?
How's that?
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
This afternoon?
What'd you just say?
Uh huh...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
Sun spot?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
1998.
Yeah...I think so.
Fire.
October 12, 1969.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
I'm glad.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
You there?
It's not your fault, Dad.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Better.
Longbranch...?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I don't know...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I'll think of something.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Barely.
Sure.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
What?
Did you stay here last night?
My whole world.
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Yes.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Damn you, Shelly!
I have to.
Who's Horace?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
We're gonna scare him?!
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Okay.  There's one.
No.
I found it outside.
All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
So let's talk.
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
It's going.
Not so bad, today.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
N...nothing.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
That's all right.  I was just...
I'm now begging you.
Okay.
Okay.
Until I hear the truth.
You don't know shit!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
About what?
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Yeah.
Nothing.
And you'll never do it again.
It's...dead.
What are you talking about?
I don't think that's such a safe idea
He is not.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
What about not-so-great writers?
Really?
I don't know what to say...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
We changed our minds.
I'd love to.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Just radio for help, okay???
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Please, hurry...
What did you find?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Do not inhale.
Do we care?
I say we go.
Do not inhale.
Here we go.
No, we're not.
It's your best play, Nicky.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
She's dying.
Our Peter?
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
In and out of bed.
We don't even like each other, do we?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
They'll lose because they're my team.
That's completely crazy.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Everything.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
I don't know if I can say that.
I'm at the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
Get yourself something to eat.
Show him who we are.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
Matthew.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
Why do you care?
You're out of bullets.
How come?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
I have excellent long-term memory.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I think I remember.
A little.
I hear good things about the new play.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Someone waiting for you?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Eleven.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
Going nearer to God!
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
"Hell!"
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
A great deal.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
First spin. Let the others march for a time.
You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
I --
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I dined at the prison.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Something's not right.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Often.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
What's wrong with him?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
Any particular reason?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
You may as well invite her here.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
Why not?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Friend?
Let's walk.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
We could go together one day.
New policy.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
Beynon.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
I want to take a walk.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Whisky and a peach.
I'm still here, Doc.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
I couldn't have... much longer.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
For exits off Main Street.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
I see it...
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
He might be ready to chop us up.
What do we do?
And switched keys.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
I mean it.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
No, I'm afraid not.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Where?
What about the vault?
Just sandwiches...
Just fine.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
That right?
Can he trust you?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
How?
Who?
Nothing. What could I do?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
What?
Christ, what...
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
No.
Really?
While he was here. You went about together?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
What girl?
Yeah.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Thanks.
What?
That's what I was wondering.
Right.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Large Scotch.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
How many?
Get knotted.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'm sorry.
That little shit!
What, and get myself beaten up again?
What you doing around here then?
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Sod off.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
We've got to take you back to London.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
That's right.
...Polacks...
Mmm...
What?
They killed the goose.
Eh?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
With River Oaks?
That's right...
That's the truth...
Huh.
They...
What?
How?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.
No, we're just...
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Not actually, no.
We are?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?
Yes.
What does that mean?
Why would they come to me?
How ya doing?
Uh-huh.
What do you care...?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole the phones.
...what am I going to do all month...
No.
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
No.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
The leads come in, I'll let...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me...
Excuse me, sir...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You're done, come down, and let's...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...then...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Murray...
Let me...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
The leads are assigned randomly...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
Twenty percent.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
It's not impossible.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
I'm sorry.
Fuck you.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
From the store.
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
What is it?
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
I don't know.
Gimlet.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
If we wait till Mon...
We'll speak to her, Jim...
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
The power to negotiate.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Guess who?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Yes.
I'm not hungry.
She couldn't decide.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
Michael...
You're not my father!
A hundred years...it's a toast.
He will grow strong.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
We're making an investment in Havana.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was hard to have him killed.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
What is it?  Can I help?
We have time.
Why?
How long does this go on?
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Sure, Mikey.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Wait... there's something else.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I don't know.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
He's going to try Panama...
Did my brother go back?
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I don't think that's necessary.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Yes, Michael.
Sleeping inside me.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
No, I'm fine.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
Yes.
You were unfair with them.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Keep them alive.
No, she's here.
Sitting right behind you.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
How much more a month?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Expect nothing fancy.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
What do I do?
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
What did she mean by going flooey?
Broke is more like it.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
No.  I'm fine.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
All right, I guess.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Cut it out!
You were a soldier?
No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
Something happened to him?
You're the one who started it.
I'm game.  Sure.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Good.  Let's get dry.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Not at all.
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
You're crazy.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
I just want to watch it, okay?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Luminal.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
No.  I expect you can't.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
What rumors might those be?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Who do you think?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
What for?
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Your girl works in there ...
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Keys were in it ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You, too, Ma...
How's Kip?
No.
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
You guys are through...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Hello, Memphis --
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah --
About what?
What?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
I can handle it --
Me...
Thank-you ...
Nah.
What?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
No problem -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
Hospital.
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Call 'em here -- ?
Mitch.
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
Oh. Okay. Right.
Oh, yeah.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
What about The Club ... ?
No worries ...
How is he -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I dunno. I know a place.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
I'll see you soon --
So what's in there -- ?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Billy, how are you?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You treated me like shit.
What are you gonna do?
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Shit.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Jimmy.
Will you stop.
He heard.
I can't make any more deliveries.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
Yeah, yeah.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No, no. It's okay.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I got dry cleaning.
But, Paulie, please.
What? Come on!
Stop crowdin the plate!
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
You don't know that.
No, I had to talk him down.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Yah, all right...
Shut up.
I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
That's one aspect of what we do.
It's touching me.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Fuck do you want?
Really?
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yes.
I've been busy.
That would be fine.
It's on the college.
I'll be okay.
I think so.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Who?
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Me too.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
What's the point?
He was my roommate in college.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
What places?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
You think so?
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Time's up.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
You've never been on a plane.
Haven't called her.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
You're kiddin' me.
Yeah.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
I didn't ask for this.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
What?
What?
Okay, sounds good.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
You know, nothing special.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Well...
If you bring the caramels.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
Some, a little.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Joe!
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'll get Rosasharn.
She got to make it.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Sure, but what is this?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
Joad. Tom Joad.
Goodnight.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
I never heard nothin' about it.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Can't you see that sticker?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
No plants.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
You promised, Tommy.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tommy.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I know that! But *where* they gone?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
I never--
We can pick anything.
In the corporate offices.
Yeah...
It's what I do.
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Really?
What do you want to do?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Yes.
I'm a professional killer.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Bad television.
What's that?
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
--She's not dead---
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Like heroin?
It's something I do...
That's probably a good idea.
I'll hide.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
No harm no foul.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Okay.
Those all seem kind of related...
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Nope.
He using her.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
He didn't.
Never enough.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Paul?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Tom.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Okay.
Fine!
Fine.
You already did.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?... Oh baby...
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Yeah. Bye.
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, let me go.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
No.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Okay.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
About what?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
May I have a suggestion?
Take your time.
I don't understa-
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I was there for that shot, actually.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Oh, how sweet.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
You!
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
She's an editor.
You're catching on.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
No!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
I understand...
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Alright sir.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Waste the dude.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
The sensitive type.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Super hero like even.
That's far out!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
I'm gonna hit you!
Cereal.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
Hmmm.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I told you, I don't play well with others.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Fucked if I care, man.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Do my ears deceive me?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
I think we've got something.
Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
What, it left a note?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Nonono, thank YOU!
555-4202.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Okay sure. What about?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Michael Myers.
I don't know!
Brady! Come with us.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many bodies did you find?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
Like a real sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
You bet.
It was the nightmare man
No.
I can't.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
No.
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
Hi Jamie.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Okay, bye.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Got it Ben.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Be here in a minute.
Now you understand?
You blame everything on kids.
We just talked.
Fun-ny. See you.
I have a place for that.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Just answer the damn phone.
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
Promise?
Lee Brackett.
He isn't a man.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Sure.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
There was no one outside.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What is it, Laurie?
I killed him...
I'm wasting time.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Oh, listen...
Well, let's do it.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Yeah.
No, he called late last night.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Well...
Oh, okay.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Ed Smythe, yes.
I don't know exactly.
Oh, Elliot!
You're out looking here?
Yes, I do.
Yes?
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Bye.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, right.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Oh, don't say those words!
I can't say anything!
I almost didn't.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Are you angry with me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Yeah.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
Oh, honey!
No, nothing.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
I can't take this anymore.
Because I have to!
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
I think they're fantastic.
How are you?
Oh...
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
True.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She really does, though.
It's, uh, you never know--
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh, yeah. 
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
You know.
Well, I just came from an audition...
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
You got it.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Yeah.  Me, too.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
We didn't hit it off.
I'm fine.
...in a really horrible way.
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, who cares?
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
You want me to be?
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
What's up...?
Yeah, so where is he?
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
...young boys, still...?
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I can make you rich.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
You seen John Brigham...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
I'll have them picked up.
Enchante.
Where do you live?
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Spoken like a Protestant.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...and that is what you need to expand.
....because we don't have any mmm...
...what did you want? 
Hey, lost again.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
...no...
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
What is your point?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Because?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
You have no idea. Now run away.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
I hope so...
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...

I think your passion is terrific.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Do you really think I care?
Not now, Wendy.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Don't get cocky, girl.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey, don't run away now.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Color me nauseous.
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Yeah, I just got back.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
How very.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I don't know. Should you?
I don't really like your friends either.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Yeah, great.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Of course.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You didn't say Simon Says.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
That's three things.
But my name's not...
Sure. Ciao.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
Is it hurting, dear?
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Open this door!
Love, you can still write to each other.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
Thank you so much!
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
You mean travel by ourselves?
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Your insight is enlightening.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
The way you just looked at me...
Bull...
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
What was it?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Ambrose. I know.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
I said she's been missing for-
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
What?
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
This isn't happening.
What?
Where is she? Where is my wife?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Ambulance.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
YOU!
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I got your bail continued.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
It's November.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Me!
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
JOEY!
Uh, no.
Yes.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
That's not what I mean...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
What about a reward for coming forward?
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
She's talking to him now.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
What's "cynical"?
Dad!
You didn't?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
They're really white.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
No, no, no, no.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It's a living.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
About us.
A man scared me.
Uh huh.
Why are you mad at each other?
Holly -- that's not so.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
He'll never appreciate it more.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Philip!  The senior partner?
I'm having the floor fixed,
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
What for, dickweed?
Grow up, Dreyer.
No.
Can we keep him?
Promise.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
Yes.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
Lieutenant.
No.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Aye.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
Me?  Of course.
What worries you?
No.  What am I to do?
I would like to say goodbye.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
The past?
I cannot explain.
A lucky guess.
Because it's my name.
Jennifer.
You look like you have.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
No.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
I've seen it.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
I know, Paul.
It will not end tonight.
No.
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Yes, sir.
Get to work.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
What?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Use more ice.
I got the gasoline --
They'll cut the power.
Keeps to himself, more like.
I don't eat junk food.
What do you mean?
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
What I want is to help my father.
We can't make the microwave work.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Go, Mickey.
Are all of you named Jones?
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
What?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
They're still in the house.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Yes.
How do I reach him?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Of course.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
What did they say?
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
The front gate would be best, General.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No, sir.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
What is it?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
When will they be here?
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I saw the sign.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
I would never do that.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
He will be here.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
I need a great favor.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
Move? Where to?
Pack the bags, we have to move.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
He wants your wisdom.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Dawn. Then they go.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Go out! Where?
No, no.
Why?
I want to know.
A Volkswagen!
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
What sort of plan?
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
What's wrong?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Thank you, sir.
When?
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Can I help you?
Go downstairs, I will help you.
I'm confused.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Not at all!
I'm moved beyond words.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Yeah...something.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Three times, to be exact.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
Did it work?
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I don't think so...
Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
No...not air --
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Back where?
Let's try down here...
He's dead...?
We're safe?
Run.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
You're hurting me.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Steven??
And then what happens?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
He would have been back by now.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Yes.  It was.
Maybe it was Colleen...
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where is she now?
My God, I heard something!
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
He's blessing the house.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Daddy help!
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Or what she was worth.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Were you fooling with the power?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
I think everything's ready.
Aubrey!
Should I...
Know what?
What are you talking about?
We're not going.
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Before.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
Did you know her very well?
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
And what did you discover?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Then tell me what to do.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Where?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
I'm sorry.
Unh-unh.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Fuck you!
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
Not quite.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
I laughed, I cried.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Rutherford Auction... that name...
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
But I said I was sorry....
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
"But we'll be the same as we started...
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
God go with you, sister.
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Prison?
How long were you in?
Uh....old badminton injury.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Baseball, why?
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
I guess that's a no.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
What job?
You certainly do.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
It's hardly the same --
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Oh, no, really, I --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
I know that, Amy.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Now, Aim --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer --
I'm sure you do.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
Forty-eight years...
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Well, I --
Huh?! But, buddy --
Yeah, but, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Say, that was a swell idea!
Yes sir...
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Well, why don't ya read it.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I --
You --
Wait a minute!
But, sir! --
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Damnit, where's my car!
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Old Faithful.
He don't look wise.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Where?
Alive?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
But you didn't have to come up here.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Thank you.
Yes.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Mr. Holland?
Wait. I want to listen.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I am not a frightened girl.
And charming?
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
She was beautiful.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
No thank you. We should be off.
So maybe you'll come too?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
So early?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You go dry off now.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
What's on your mind? Don't --
What do you mean?
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Fine.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
But what?
Thanks for the advice Dave.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
Yeah. You?
Mom. Are you ok?
You're not a psycho!
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
It's really quite all right.
It's not like we're too busy.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
But not too ashamed.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
I gotta get to English class.
See ya.
Moisture! Moisture!
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
The Idiot?
Thanks for the advice dad.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Out.
Tell Sandy? What?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yeah. Yours?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Yeah.
Greetings, Charles.
What are you doing?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
What's the D.A. got them on?
But there wasn't any...
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
No.
That's right.
That's right.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
To do nothing.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What is it?
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Huh?
What kind of stuff?
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Yes, and very beautiful.
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Listen to me.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You let them do it.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Does it?
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Sit still. It's not finished -
Don't mock, Claudia...
And you never cried -
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Still my beautiful child.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Yes, and very beautiful.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
What do you mean?
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Give it to me!!!
I want it!
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes...
I want a woman.
It can't be...
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
I know. Let her alone.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
You're not lying to me, are you?
What about a radio?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Who? Who is here?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
Don't even think about it.
Some.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Can't what?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
You know me to well.
Fine. Show me the body.
Who?
I don't know.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
He's in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I'll talk real slow.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Rio, baby!
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How's Julie?
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Drunk again?
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
On my word! That's what they believe.
I don't know now without my father.
They shall not hurt you
Thea is an orphan.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
Whet do you mean?
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
That your father and I ——
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
I don't understand you.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her name is Thea?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I can't understand that.
You are my friend.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Then foreclose!
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
All right –– all right.
Carter –– bank examiner.
Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
No, of course not.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Well, wait and see.
No!
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
The Building and what?
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
All right.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
No.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Yes –– charge.
Oh, George.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Hello, Violet.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Hello?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
All right, sir.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
In that place?
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Have you made up your mind?
Didn't you tell her?
Would you rather leave?
To keep from being an old maid.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Oh, shucks . . .
Hmm? Well, I . . .
But of course.
Stop paddling!
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
In here.
What camera?
If there is, develop it!
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Every day?
Okay, okay.
I kind of had plans....
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Did you get any pictures?
What else you got?
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Too late, it's written.
Can't you tell?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Home it is.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
For me?
Damn.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Do you?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Mike's out there.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Hiya yourself.
Waiting for Andy.
3:30.
Shut up.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Figure they split?
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
I love it.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
You going with Patrick?
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
What the hell is he doing?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
You buying?
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Get out of here!
Hi, baby.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
That we swim.
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Yes.
Yes?
No, you're not.
Sounds wonderful.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
What's up?
Okay.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
I don't understand.
But you --
Only to myself.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Thanks for helping.
Why are you?
They still seem nervous.
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
He's missing.
Are you really?
He's diving!
SEAN!
Hold still, damn it!
Don't you dare.
That?
It's disappeared.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Don't hurry back.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
We're in love.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
No way....
We forgot to stop at the store.
What's wrong?  What happened?
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
I like it.  Really....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
He heard that.
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I'm still five....
Who's coming?
You guys must be starving....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
You'll be sorry.
The whole idea is preposterous....
Just like that?
Yes I can....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Oh, boy....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop busting my hump....
The readings suck....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
When I signed on....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
So did I....
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
You don't like my voice...?
Screw you, Jake....
I've got to get to her....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
I'm training to....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yes.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
I think you're here all day.
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
O.K.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No, you didn't.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Pay me, and I shut up.
Then give me that Zippo.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
To throw out of the window.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
You want me to stop the car?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
Car accident.
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
And did they?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
No.
Yes.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
You should. It's wonderful.
Which is what?
It's not possible right now.
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I can't identify him ..
I wanna be near you ...
I don't want them to arrest you.
Yes, Sir.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Whass going on here?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
One of the accountants.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Jerry!  Do something --
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Listen to me, it's over.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
My son... my mind...
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Same to you.
Easy, easy --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
He's in the living room asleep.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Another drink please.
I understand your anxiety.
That's your word?
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Rod, get on the camel.
How do I know?
No, I don't know.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No, you're --
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
You okay?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
I'm not your brother!
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Quiet!
This is how you play God.
What is it?
What's a bad idea?
People change.
He's this way.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Think.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Who's that?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
He loves you too.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I thought you were an expert.
Sure.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
NO!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
The last of my breed.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Any weapons, radios?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
This plane can not land!
I have never been on this island!
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Isn't it obvious?
Piss.
Good.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
You're going too?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
No way.
I don't know.
Where's Kelly?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
What?!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Birdshit?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
No.
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Are you sure?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Small versions of adults, honey.
We were right!
We're out of a job.
Not just every six weeks.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - barfs them up - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The fences are electrified, right?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Like hell it is!
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
And scary.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Please - - chance it.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
In a box under my seat.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
I doubt it.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Nope.
Try to!
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I didn't say I was scared.
I know.
You're sure?!
We gotta do something.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
All night.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
What?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Who's chest?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Insomnolesence...
Me too. I'm drunk.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Great.	When can you do it?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
How's that possible?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Up there.
What is it really?
Yes -- we do.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I know.
No.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Eight -- and seven months.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
-- Just doing our job.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
No!
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
We're leaving.
Jack!...  Jack!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Native costume?
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
An ape ... some kind of ape.
) They are now.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
What?
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
What about him? Yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Don't belong?
You think people hate you.
Didn't want you.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Mm.
Mm.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
How would I remember?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
What do you think?
Try some other ways. 
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Mm.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
How?
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
I don't like getting splashed.
What am I supposed to say?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
You're going back?
They don't scare me any more.
How is it back there?
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
It's not so bad.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
Goodbye, Pete.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Wow!  French toast, really?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Uh huh...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
You mean for good?
Dad?
It's my name too.
You like it?
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
I do not, your honor, however--
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Six years.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Objection!
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
I...I don't know...
I suppose...
Yes.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What?
So do you.
Ted, do you love him?
What?
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
What?!?
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Six.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
No, but--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Got it.
I understand.
I'm sure.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
No.  I don't think so.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Sure.
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
Any day.
You and Charley?
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
It is alright, Father.
Can I free the prisoners?
No!
General Chiang.
I have.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Time to study.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
How many?
What do you think?
No. Not very big.
I do not know, Holiness.
Look here!
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
And, America?
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
You decide.
You cannot.
The Chinese.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
How could I ever leave?
It is a difficult situation.
I see that.
Oh, yes.
No.  Do you?
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
You're crawling around like a--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
It came from across the lake.
Raincheck.
So profound and fat.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I don't know!
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
Right.
You ready on shore?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
I never had sex with you!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Are you sure?
Oh, bullshit.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Never been to Maine before?
So I don't like tents, why--
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
You <u>did</u>, you--
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
It's okay.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Okay.
Well...
You wouldn't?
He heeds a tourniquet.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Likewise.
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Is the dead guy in there?
I'm fine, thank you.
Seconds.  Three, four.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
What?
Wild guess.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Kelly--
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Well, except for the one girl.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Who's the subject?
And what is that, sir?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Murdered...? How?
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Starling -
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Yes.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
Later, listen, I'll -
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
We leave in the morning?!
Let us go, miss.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
I'm sorry.
When? How?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
"Some"?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Dark haired...
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
By your leave, sir.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Granted.
France.
La victoire.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
What?...
No!
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
The escape bubbles?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
And it killed Bo?
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
Hook's on 24...
It...almost got you.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
What music?  There ain't no music.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Who cares?
He's tanking on us...
I'm going to kill it!
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
The air's stopped.
Your pocket?
Seven hundred for the pair.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
It's a Samoan pub.
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Try that one.
That's no way to answer the phone.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
OK, open the gate.
What the fuck is going on?
There is only three of us here.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
What do you mean, me?
I'11 meet you in the car.
You will what?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
I can't take any more school.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Yes, sir--
I am, sir.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
You're testing me?
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
So they stayed in Florida?
But they were Indians themselves.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
My father.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
Appreciate it, sir.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That's where he fell.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
You go by your old house?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
And the ten thousand?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Steve?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
A little older than Paloma is now.
I never said that. It was just that boy--
You ever play one of these?
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
What was your deal with him?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Of course you can.
For a while.
It's Saturday.
So I've heard--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
Most people did, yeah.
Amado.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Pilar--
Nothing.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
I came back 'cause you were here.
Couple months before I was born--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah--
Just doing my job.
Another woman?
I know that.
He's gonna find out.
You heard right.
doorway) And who's that?
Knew what?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
What about death?
You'll do more.than that.
Yes...
Yes.
You don't?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
I'm no bodyguard.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I don't know where you'd start.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
No.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Hang on!
Harry...
Good.  There.  Yes?
No word from D'Amour?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Mr. D'Amour?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Maybe I just bought it.
You know of him?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Shit...
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Yes...
At birth.  I don't know you --
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Will that do?  No?
Is that all?
And you believed him?
Yes.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
No!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
No!
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Philosophy.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
No, how about you?
I'm here for the week.
No way.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
Ok, whatever you want.
We established that we have no communication.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Working.
Yeah.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Around.
I'll miss you.
Yes?
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Tomorrow.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Bye.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Claire...
I found the pentacle.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
And how would you describe him?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
My secretary?
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
I hope so.
Something he said, just before...
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Miette, come here and relax.
You just call?
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
What's the bible for?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
Terrific.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
Whish the circumstances were different.
I know who he is.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Get out of here.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
It's Detective Smythe.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
How is he?
Don't curse.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
Thanks, sweetheart.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You're a caterer?
This time get your feet set.
Huh?
Shh.  It's okay.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
It's okay.
Get used to it, babe.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
No.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
Oh, great.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
She hates all freshmen.
Just one word of advice for next season.
I wouldn't know.
Just not my type, I guess.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
He works at a bank.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't care.
For how long?
So that means I have to ride with you.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
God, here we go.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
What?
I know, right?
Yeah.
Fine, Quincy.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Quincy...
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey, what's up.
Cheap date.
I don't think so.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
No.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
What?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Then why are you so upset?
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
Keep your voice down.
Nona, please.
We were just studying.
Sorry.  You okay?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
No.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
ooohhhhhh no.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Brain and Lung.
Oh that's good.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
No.  No.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
No one else in there with you?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
-- is not my boyfriend.
yeah, good, ok.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
No, no.
I'm sorry --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Can I tell you something?
That was so great what you just said.
I've got troubles.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
What?
Yes.
Yes.
Ready to go,go,go?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
I don't know.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
-- Richard.
Son, don't --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
I was listening --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Might of been before my time.
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
You do?
No.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
There's no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Go fuck myself?
No.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Is this 509-9027?
Alright.  Thank you.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Like I said, yeah --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
He passed away.
What name?  My name?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Is Linda here?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
...ok...
Calm down.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Yes.
I got in trouble at school.
As fast as I can.
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Maybe...I don't...
I don't know.
...I don't know...
I don't know what I've done.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
You need to sober up.
Linda --
Hi.
Yeah.
Water.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Thank you.
I need this one.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Should be one-thirty.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
I don't know.
Stand up.
Yes.
Go to bed.
Hi.
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
D'Artagnan.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
I am with you!
A body.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
It is also a place of burial.
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Who?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
You are right.  But it is a trap.
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is its antidote?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
How did you know -- ?
How did you --
Phillippe.  Rest now.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
... tired.  Must... lie down.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
I am unhurt --
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Sire, I --
Cooperate?
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Fine...
Fine -
And who are you?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Screw him!
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
When do they go to press?
Book code?
Read it.
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Somebody hurt him?
No.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
You said the guy down here is good.
I know...
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
To recover the mind set.
You.
What is it?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
You wanna watch this or what?!
He had to.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
This is our boy...!
What?
Stay in the trees.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
It's a surprise.
Yes, are you okay...?!
I have work to do at the plant.
You'll come by?
No.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes...
Oh, God.
God, no.
No.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Cut the general crap.
That's true.
He only bit women so far, right?
We have it good, don't we?
Hey, baby! Where are you?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I remember.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
...after a while.
No.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes.
No.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Fight what?
No.  Caspiar.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I refuse.
Hi George!
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Hi... am I late?
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
If you want...
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
You're a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
Yes, your Holiness?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
They're gonna lynch him!
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Oh shit.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Should Tank I.D. it?
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
You killed them.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
... Yeah.
Really?
What happened to them?
Goddamnit!
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
They'll be able to track it.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Stand up and see for yourself.
But what if...?
How do you know all this?
It's an honor.
You could say that.
What does that mean?
Wild, isn't it?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yes.
Why?
Yes I do.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Good.
Do it!
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
How did you know...?
What?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
What is the Matrix?
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
It's going into replication.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Not yet.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
What the hell just happened?
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Sounds good.
Well the guy over there said...
Why?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
She don't look Jewish.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Should I slap him?
That's not going to help.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
How?
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
No.
No.
That bad, huh?
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
$20.
Whatever.
Hostess?
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Did you?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Count it.
Yeah, I think so.
Well...no.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
He's coming.
Love that name.
And you could care less --
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
It's for the party, Dad --
'Goddam party'!
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Yes, it is.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
I thought you were buying my company.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Right away.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Thank you.
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
What an odd pairing.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
A voice?
Did you just hear something?
What?!
What do you mean?
'Just kidding'?
How nice for you both.
Yours.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Well, that's very interesting.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Yes.
She knows you real self?
Rass!
No.  Nothing.
What?
Are you?
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Love.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Excuse me?
And I appreciate you, too.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Girlfriend?
I said get out.
It was everything.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Thank you.
'Threw' you?  Where?
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning, Bill.
Yes?
What do you mean?
I understand.
No.
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't know.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
'Fish'?
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'm her father!
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Say again?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I am not a dream.
Death!
I don't!
I'm here.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Time.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Yeah, I give a shit.
Sure.
Yes, I believe I do.
You think Drew will go for it?
Hi, honey.
How did you know?
What were you going to say?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Then what will you say?
I don't know.
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
Why not?
No --
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
As requested.
Then why is this my handwriting?
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah, I remember you.
Don't say anything else.
Strip!
So you have information for me?
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Kill him.
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Where is he?
I'll go see him.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Why not?
Thank you.
Who's your boyfriend?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Probably left it in your room.
No! Should I?
From who?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again.

There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Are you sure?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.

Somehow, I'll know!

What's your twenty?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
It's a rip and a hit.
You can't.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Later!  Do you dance?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Of course.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
'Cause she will tell you.
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
Something's wrong.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Who knows...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
What's your Miami PD badge number?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Goodbye.
He did volunteer one time...
Yes.  What's up?
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
What would you do...?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Men, they mostly faggots.
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
For what?
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
I mean, dammit, where you live?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Don't need a comb.
Twenty bucks...
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
What?
What?
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
KNOCK IT OFF!
What?
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Stop shitting me, man!
I know.
Oh Jesus! 
Sure.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
I'll pay extra
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
But didn't have heroin.
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
You know where it is?
What is it? . . . Billy?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Who got the Frenchman out?
What's your name?
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
New York's finest.
What?
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
You got a better way up?
Just do it!
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Don't get kinky here...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
We?
Maybe they lied to you.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
How?!
No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
What are they...?
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Nothing.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
It has no nobility.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
The Sistine Chapel?
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I don't know.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
The what?
I said that?
Have to wait.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
A toast?
To Misery.
Why would you lose me?
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
Maybe.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Just from his agent.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
It's good you found it.
Maybe you can, Libby.
So do I...
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
That'd be a first.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
From her point of view or mine?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Then don't say it.
To do what?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
And you're happy about that?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
What are you talking about?
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Not for seven more minutes.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Listen to what?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
And six billion in the world.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Just about..
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Ethan, tell me -
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Yes, I gathered as much.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
She must still be on the property.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Nyah still on the property?
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Do I?
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
So what do you suggest?
Good idea.
We got it.  On your feet.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Who is they, who is they?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
Sure...
You didn't have to.........
What about you?
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Go secure.
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
Why don't you come back with me?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
I wouldn't dream of it.
What about Job?
Let's move!
Jack.
Always.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
Jim we canít.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Very well.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
He's our guy.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
- and picked us up in the States -
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Youíre probably right.
And get a doctor.
Keep counting Claire.
Of course I can hear you.
I don't know.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Yes.
No. You were there.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
What killed him?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
You have too many dogs.
He's in Palermo.
I don't understand.
Yesterday.
Stupid.
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
No!
A wolf without a foot!
Where are you taking me?
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
Take it easy.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
I can't do that!
I'm in love with you!
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Come on.
It's the best thing there is.
How can you ask me that?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
He didn't come!
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
No. I'm gonna wait.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
No?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Yes?
I don't understand.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
We should talk alone.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Where's pop?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
It was a miracle!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Definitely!
Sure!
What do you do?
Why do men chase women?
Sure.
You were a tiger last night.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
Oh. Right.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
NI!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Had enough?
Come, Patsy.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Greetings King Arthur.
Quite.
What?
There.
It is the rabbit.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
Bloody peasant! 
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Do me a favour.
What is your name?
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
The Prince ... ?
Oh, I see,  Right.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Sir Galahad!!
No, It's nothing!
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
Quite.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Whom you address.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
Who'll bring it to me?
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
There are important papers from --
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Quite.
I'm not married.
The greasy pole.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Aye, ma'am.
Are they worth reading?
What does he know about the Highlands?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
Yes, ma'am?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
I do not accept.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
You can't know that for sure.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Dear oh dear.
Yes.
No, indeed.
Cold is good!
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
A few days, ma'am.
No.  I shall be out walking.
From whom?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Yeah...
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Laurie's.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
And beat it at it's own game.
Put in a quarter.
What?
There...
Check your read-out.
We don't have a choice!
Hold my keys, then.
Well, it's a long story...
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
Of course I am.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
No.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
How's that?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
I was afraid of that.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We'll take our check.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
But I want to.
And who are we auditioning for today?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Go ahead.
Oh boy.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Yeah.
Where at?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Where's the dock ?
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
I'm working on it.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
What ?
Not listening !
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
What do you mean ?
Let's go.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When will that be ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I am thirty two.
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I was.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I'll see that bet.
I think I'll see hat action.
How can this happen ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
Hi. I brought some wine.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Why don't you shut up now.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Are you writing a poem?
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What about giving the other guy a break.
Me, I'll know!
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Suspended from school, my mother??
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
Great.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Was it a nice funeral?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Totally groovy huh?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Maybe he's hungry.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Give it back Nicholas!
MOM!
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
WHAT??
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
May I use the phone please.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
This is a totally barbaric custom.
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Was Rose.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
This is it I guess.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
Oh...what's that?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Is that a yes?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
She'll be all right baby.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Is there milk in them already?
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
O.K.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Good for you baby.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I think it's still available.
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Is there enough room?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Yes.
Really?
Okay.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Dad?
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Sorry.
No, sweetie, not yet.
Hi.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
No sweetheart, you can't.
No, no.
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Oh come on.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Will you tell her I came by?
Thank you. Bye.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Uh huh.
Mostly love, and romance.
No, I'm divorced.
Aarrggh.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Uh huh.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Yes.
It's my mother.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Duck!
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
So?
You're right, let's knock it down.
It is not.
No.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
I should look different.
Something like that.
... weeks.
Kindred spirits.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
Someday she'll thank you.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
Let me rephrase that...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I was gonna predict that.
I've missed a step.
Gold nose hair clippers.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I know Ben.
It doesn't say th...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
... Thomas, yeh.
Mirrors.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Till the gas ran out.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Michael!!
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No.  I've got you.
Me either.
... maybe it's congratulations.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Well, it happens.
Shhh.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
What is that sup...
What do you have to buy?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
What's wrong honey.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
You're so good.
You'll have to speak up.
Green.
She's going to rest now.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
How is that?
What does he want?
Okay.
President.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
To the bathroom.
What is a turkey shoot.
Hi, Sherry.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
A little. What do you need?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
No.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh... Well.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Tom. You remember?
I'm not sure.
Well...
Yea.
What?
I'm sorry but I have to go.
He's pretty well known down here.
Out.
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
You do?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You always live there?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Who?
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Sure thing.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Don't stop!
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
I can appreciate that.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
By all means.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Not good.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
All right, Mickey.
Do you miss Mallory?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
When have they ever been right?
Sure.
No.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
I do, too.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
They've hypnotized the nation.
That's the way of the world.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Next week's episode.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Wayne---
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Wayne Gayle.
Okay.
Perfecto!
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Lose 'em.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
All right, you get out of here, man!
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Okay.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Okay.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Went to college, huh?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
You keep asking me why I'm here.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
That's the way he is.
What d'you mean?
I didn't know you had one.
I'll see you later.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
Okay, I guess.
How about it?
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You still didn't answer my question.
We'll be all right.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
What're you going to do?
Watch out!
There's nothing to say.
Duff--
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Who're you?
Plannin' on getting married?
She'll do.
Sorry.
I said, she's in great shape.
Okay.
How are you?
Guess it's never been easy.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
I doubt it.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
That'll make the folks very happy.
Hi.
I ain't drunk, honey.
What's the matter now?
Omar, listen to me--
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Since when?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
Of course...
The Elders, mon...
How's the villa's security?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
It hasn't yet.
What's he doing to my gear?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Can you read my mind?
Are you even really alive?
You're pleasant tonight.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Can you walk?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Nobody has.
How long, Dixie?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
What's my end?
Almost two days.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
So you're a wire junkie.
Too late?
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Put the gun down, Case.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
They'll cut you down.
Give me five minutes.
Something exotic I hope.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
You're out of time, man.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Shut up.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Nope.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Yeah.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Hidden camera.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Five-- Six--
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
They hid my car--
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Better than I...
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
I know.
I-
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Oh I don't think so.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
I don't have to say that.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Thanks. So do you.
Yeah, I have.
You were attracted to me?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Everybody knows about--
Barrel.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
No!
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
It's getting there.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Who's Lisa?
Oh, please...
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
What about it?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Whoa!
Why won't you talk to me?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
'Morning, honey.
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
He's full of shit.
I had such an awful dream.
Research.
Deal.  Thanks.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
It's an amazing gift.
He's real.
Sure.
You did it the other night.
I don't do that shit.
Why is that?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Nancy...
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Sounds like a rough time.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
With Hypnocyl?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Doesn't matter.
Try me.
Remember -- open mind.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
No...
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Mary Helena.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Uh, fourteen.
This is stupid.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Where...here?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Now you're lying.
I'm not listening.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I'm an actress.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Hi.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
And what happens next in the dream?
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
I thought you were leaving.
You abide by rules like that?
What did you say?
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
This is the place.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Well done you.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Well, get a message through to him too.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
No.  What's that?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Stay forever.
Don't ask.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Anna Scott?
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Well, thanks, that's great.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
This is Henry James film?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Can I help you?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
May I help you, sir?
Point taken.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
What book?
I was in luh-love with her.
I-I-I...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Sorry, ma'am.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Right!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
No way.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Thank you, ma'am.
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
H-H-Hearts.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
H-Hey, M-Mack.
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Thank you.
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Ca-na-da...
They went that way.
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Shhh...
My feet hurt...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
That's nice. Send me a post card.
I just started!
I'm not running a charity ward...
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me too! Me too!
Yeah, it's cold!
What is it?
Oh, what was that?
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
We'll let you know.
'Kay, Mac!
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
You're on!
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Sure...
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
What?
P.A. What the hell is that?
On what?
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Oh...
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Bet you ass...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
Oh, yeah...
No, she wasn't my sister.
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Let's find a telephone.
Yes.  We did.
But, Faith--
Thanks.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
You didn't answer my question.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Who says I don't love him?...
Because.  I know where he is.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
NO.
Hi.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
What?
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
You aren't?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
GET OUT!!
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
No.  He smokes.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, what's your point?
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Yes you did.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
What'd you find?
Only what?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Her brother.
Sure you did.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Packing.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
What?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh.
I thank you.
That's exactly what you are.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She didn't give me a chance.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Why Edie, I—
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Tommy, what happened?
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
You training to be a nun or something?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Man, you were a mess!
I only live up there and across the roof.
The things that go on.
Oh she's a beauty.
In a saloon?
I am?
What a fruitcake you are!
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
Go ahead, wear it.
What I did to Joey.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Well, it's over.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
Let me by.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Are you on the level, Father?
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
I'm just resting my feet.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Easy. Easy, boy.
Forty-five bills.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
Thanks, Johnny... .
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
What do you mean?
Go on, beat it!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Where?
It frightens me.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Be careful!
What can we do against them?
A situation easily remedied.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Ahh, there is yet time.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
For what!?!
Is there time?
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aannnnaahhnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Tell me, how do you do that?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
Who are you?
Thank you.
His assistant.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Shit.
I'm a tourist.
Now you're talkin'.
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Love is funny.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
You know how I felt about her.
Jack --
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
They're in 7D.
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Let's go outside and talk.
We're leaving.
I thought everything.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
You'd probably tell me.
You have to be kidding.
Who was it answered the phone?
Really.  He has a cop's face.
Because you're having too much fun.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
I called your room from downstairs.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I'm just going to the bathroom.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
Pretend I'm somebody else.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
In the trunk?
Yeah?  She said that to you?
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Five point two.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
That time?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Like what?
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Really?
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
How you know that?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You a lawyer?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
The State Theater?
He's still married though, huh?
We don't get to talk much any more.
I'd like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
It's possible.  Why?
I told you, he isn't here.
That's right, just me.
I don't have any idea.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Where the fuck is Foley?
Ten gees.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Red...Strange?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Sir, I --
Where's that lizard?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Yeah.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Boxin'.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
How did you?...
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
God help them.
All of 'em.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
Stag movies. Smokers.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
It's that jerk Walter.
Charlie...
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Refresh my memory.
Would you?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Great, isn't it?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Who?
Save it.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
What?
Of course.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
What about Janet?
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
What, why?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
Is that one of your poems?
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
For everyone.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
I'm just happy to see you.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Rosalie Testa!
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
What was?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
What's that?
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
Richard, take it easy.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
I... um...
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
Well... uh... thanks...
I suppose so.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Yes... why?
I'll be fine, Dad.
It sucked.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
A reaction to AZT...
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Maybe you should think about it.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I have AIDS.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Little baby girl.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
As in, the vegetable?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
We're friends of Beckett's.
Let's find you a drink.
Sure. It's fine.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
What?
Sure thing.
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
How many do you know?
Yes, we did.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
You had one guy "like that?"
Dr. J.!
We ought to be suing him.
Jesus.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Charles...
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Think about what?
One or two.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
But they...they could still be....
But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Like what?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
How many?
That's what I said.
I never said I was.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
For now.
What?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Oh, so I'm disposable?
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
No. She's not.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
What are you doing there?
Remembers what?
And they fell out of the sky with you?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
The evidence was very meager --
Yo!
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Let's find them all.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What signal?
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
What?
He wouldn't leave her.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
With one of them.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Then you admit --
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Shhhh!
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Says he can't walk.
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
I got one...
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
No!
Yeah.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
You know what I'm talking about!
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
How far does this train go?
Well..
Not tonight.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Much too late.
That's all there is.
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Couldn't be.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
So have I.
Do you have to leave the note?
That's right.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
So that I will never be found.
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Do you think I was faking?
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Who told you I was married?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What does he see?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
To do what?
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
You asked for it.
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Why not here?
Fascinated.
Sometimes.
What's a buzzer?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
You're not English.
How's life treating you?
Round of golf Saturday?
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
That COULD BE TOLD.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
Did I do something wrong?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
With what motive?
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
You get it's brother.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Well.  What about it?
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Warm water, no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
How about Magruder?
That leaves two strangers.
She might.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Why should I mind?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Years, why?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
What a shame.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
Yes.
I will, thanks.
Well, we were just...
I'm not sure I can face it.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
Hello.
Freshman and sophomores...
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Very thoughtful.
I have to be up early. 
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
I haven't really thought about it.
Why not.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
The Argies.
I'm not here.
That's good.
No, thanks Dad.
No.
Yes.
U-huh.
She said that?
Darling Susan.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
No.
Not yet.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
You gotta earn trust.
My man!
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
But you're not alone.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Yes, sir.
Not so far.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
This Zen master surfer.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Figured you did.
Kid, get outta the way!!
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Who cares!
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Something... in the trees...
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
You know you can't win this one.
The best friend I ever had.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Hawkins?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
He's not really my uncle.
Please, we hardly know each other.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Yes.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
The price just went up to ten.
Not exactly.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Fine.
What?
You mean they don't have hookers.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
I sell them.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Please.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
He died a long time ago.
Shall we mingle?
I'll guard them and you with my life.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
We're letting them slide?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Goodbye, Bill.
Let him answer.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Kit!  Where've you been?
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Was that you?
I pray for that.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
What?
Okay.
Vivian.
Will I like it?
Miss Vivian.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I'm just looking, thanks.
'Scume me.
I just might do that.
So it's to be torture.
I swear it will be done.
You're a silly girl.
Should I be?
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Anybody want a peanut?
Veer left. Left. Left!
What do I do?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
-- what? --
But you don't know where he is.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Yeah. It's really good.
-- well, when does it get good?
I don't be-leeve this.
I don't understand.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
It won't be easy, Sire.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
Shall we track them both?
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Of course.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And our assets?
In that case --
He's already dead.
Are you a rotten liar.
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
What's that?
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Thank you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Nothing comes to mind.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Inconceivable!
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
A little bit.
What?
What are you saying?
"I want to croon,
"Honeymoon,
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Liebkind, no!
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Yes.  We would!
Come on.  Let's get going.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Nice girl.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Oh, the best one.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What have you done, LSD?
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
We won.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
How early?
Or arrived with her.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
And when she left, she never came back.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Money.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
What?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
What difference does that...
Just what he told your detective.
Don't you know?
A good reason, I suppose.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Where could he have gone?
Who's he?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
What makes you sound so certain?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
The bathroom.
Thank you. Again.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Maybe you saw Mary!
At this hour?
Leave me alone!
Mother, please...
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did I?
Did she talk?
Indeed, he has often told me.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Maybe you're right.
You found Buckley?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
He isn't here.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Heaven knows. A lot.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Yes.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
You taking any medication?
Where to?
What universe are you in, Paul?
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
So I can move on.  You too.
Well, I got to see her.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What is it, Rose?
What'd you do, Rose?
What did you expect?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
You won't die, Rose.
Okay.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
But how would you find him?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Well... maybe...
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
They're discussing it.
What are they doing, Doll?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Buddy, that was my place.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
What?
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
Is she all right?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
Fine.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Yes, sir.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Yes, sir.
You mean a farm?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Yes, Ma'am.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
... okay... you made your point.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Entertainers don't count.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
It's not gonna happen.
Bullshit.
Follow me.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Where have you been?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Murderer?  Really?
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Sounds good.
Your wish is my command.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
Yoda spoke of another.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Luke!
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
All set.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
It'll work. It'll work.
I don't know.
Ahhh...
Hold me.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Good, I hate long waits.
Come on! Come on!
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
We shall double our efforts.
Here goes nothing.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Your Royal Highness.
Oh, no.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
There is no conflict.
Never-r-r!
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
For you.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
You know this earth - this person.
A decision had to be made.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Makes you cry
Goodbye
Oh my, my,
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Creature of the night.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
I think it's closed.
...I suppose.
...I suppose.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Don't tease me.
I'll be waiting.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Paulie!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
Why?
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
I agree.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Sparrin'?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I like yella teeth.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
...Tomato?
...What?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Spider Rice.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Ya got heart.
I never had good footwork.
Real good.
'Bout what?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ain't had time to check 'em.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Looks, huh?
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ice skate.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
...No.
Gazzo's a good man.
Whatta you think?
What can I do about it?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maroon, right?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They?
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Toon cops worked me over.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
What a gasser.
Doom.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Then I'll leave thee.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Good-morrow, cousin.
At thy good heart's oppression.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Art thou hurt?
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Romeo, come forth.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
I thought all for the best.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Leaving...
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
And who are you?
Which leads us to...
That's why you were riding with him.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
I thought I did.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
I take it you still want the money...
Enough!
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
Now that is an interesting proposition.
I swear...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Not exactly.
How did you know?
What a surprise...
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
You should learn a little patience.
That's what I thought.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Like Larry or Swede.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Know what?
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
But you can't.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
You see the bullet?
Dark ops?
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
I don't know...
Right now?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
So I do it.
I'll work on it...
Finish it!
You sure?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Seven thousand...
Why?  Are you kidding me?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Maybe.  Who cares?
Torch it?!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I don't know...
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
How much?
Hello.
You mean that guy was an agent?
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Nothing happened?
He's not, he's...
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
This just might be our ticket!
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
What are you getting at?
Why would someone do that?
Maybe I should come along.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Anything...specific?
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
I don't know...
I can't hear a word you're saying!
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Dwayne put the gun down --
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
I'm not getting an answer.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I'd like to see you try.
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
This is your ship?
El Capitan?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
No.  It's my first time.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I'm sorry.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
I am a tourist.
Don't look at my ass!
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
And you ain't black!
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
No.  She's a school teacher.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
What?
I cannot go to LA...
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
What did you say?
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
She's walking back towards the door.
There's people up here!
Take it!
She never even looked at you.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No mu-shu.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
End of the line.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
Now you know.
Any leads?
Yes, Master.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
I know, Master, but...
This is still Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
They asked for the best street man I had.
Tell me about it.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
No.
A little.
What plate?
No.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Yes, I think so.
No, fish is a PM food.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
What's wrong with that?
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
It's called a dress.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Carter, shut up!
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Do it!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Maintain eye contact.
Good one!  Thanks.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
"Never say die."
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
-- The luau for Maggie.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You have one?
Without oxygen...
You can turn that finger around.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Seven-fifty.
You afraid to try?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
You humiliated me!
I kissed him back.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me?
Well, you do have the dress.
Where?
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
No, I'm just going to head home.
Quick.  Very quick.
No.  It's my life.
No.
Yeah.
That's good.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who's married to --
Nope.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Does it have wheat in it?
And then I'll see you in New York --
It was my mother's.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
About what?
Not.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
"I want to meet you..."
I always wondered about that too.
Turn on your radio!
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Is this crazy?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
So I mailed your letter.
M.F.E.O.?
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Howard.
What?
Yes, I did.
Any time.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
How amazing.
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
It's hard to imagine.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
She died.
Why not?
I don't know --
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Seventy... eight.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Good.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
I just called for a second.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Victoria? She's okay.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
This is the one I like.
No.
It was all they had.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
What about it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
What do you mean?
Hi.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
I don't make policy.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
An American.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
Yes. We will light the candles.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
I did forget. Luís told me.
He'll have it good. Some day.
They say I am no good to you.
What makes you so sure?
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
I'm going back tomorrow.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
Will you be still?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
I thought maybe you forgot...
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You should have helped her without being asked.
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
What attitude?
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Ouch.
Colette ...
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
And you admire that?
I try.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Find a new job.
You always been this stubborn?
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
What?
Why's that?
You don't say.
Can you set that up?
10%.  That's ...
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Not tonight.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
No  You think she's a tweaker?
No. I'm good.
Yes, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
I don't trust anybody.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
That was my idea.
Okay! Okay!
I'll keep that in mind.
Yeah, dickhead.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
This chink have a name?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Jesus.
My name is Tom.
It speaks!
What's he holding?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
And what does this have to do with me?
What?!
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
There's no motels around here.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Shit, that was no big deal.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Keep trying.
White-walls?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
I don't expect to live that long.
You don't count.
Simpson.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
I've got a line on one.
PUSH!
Nope.
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
It doesn't take this.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Vecchio.
Yeah.
I know.
I'll do my best.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Sure, Reiben.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Ours is not to reason why.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
And Sarge?
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
What are we likely to run into?
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
I'm gonna call her.
Okay, I got it.
See you tomorrow.
I am.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
I like him a lot.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Alright.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Hmmm....
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah?
You think so?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Come on.
Okay, bye, I will.
What did you say?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Right.
Oh.  I was putting the...
This is so noble.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
How can I look at you and say this?
What's wrong?
You need to study?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
No.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Are you?
I know this part, keep reading.
No way.
Yeah.
Alright.  Key?
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Yeah, what's that?
True.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
Look -
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
Nice things cost money.
She's good.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Yes.
Do what?
Are you losing money?
They arrived, can you believe it?
No?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They've broken their pattern.
On national television.
thought he was doing AA.
I won't.
What is it?
Who is this?
That's okay.
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
What?
You have a right to be angry.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
No, it's not.
Good question. You took the bait.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
Until now.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Can we turn the light on?
C'mon. Let's go.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Yeah, right.
Dewey, there's no such place.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Don't do this.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Gotta.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
But she's standing right next to you.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Hello.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Good bye Ben.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Absolutely.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
They've got her!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Sure.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I am Gale Weathers!
None.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Who?
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Who's this.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
Yes, sir.
I'll only stay a sec.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
You lost your mom...
Are you serious?
What?
I called my dad.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
Fuck you.
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Do you like scary movies?
You have to have a favorite.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
To talk.
You getting scared?
I believe you...
No...
Turn off the light.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
YES!
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
No, not yet.
Then what are you doing here?
Mind if I join you?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
I'll send you a copy.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
So where are you?
Got it.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
The why'd the police let him go?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
He came to make up.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
What happened?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
It's past seven.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I bet he's pissed.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
I don't know, they just did.
I'm in.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I heard.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Where was the girl?
It's not too far away now.
Why?
NO!
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
You know that's not true.
What the fuck is going on?
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
What?
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
What about sports?
I read.  Remember reading?
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
Okay.  But, what?
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Let's go.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
What?  Assessing fines?
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
We had him.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
Wait!
Don't do this... please...
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I'm sorry, I only...
I hate this city.
Did the wife confess?
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
Why don't you finish the job?
It was, I tell you!
I ain't wearing no gun.
Dunno...Seems so.
Yes sir...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Captain Clayton...Captain!
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You got it with you?
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
But I just bought a good blanket.
What?
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
You crazy?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
1976.  What happened back then?
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
The title won't do.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
Really?
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
Done.
yet cannot love nor write it.
A share of the profits.
Of course not!
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
As soon as I have found my muse
Who wrote that?
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
The one who came with your letter?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
"Is the day so young?"
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
I am, Master Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I like her.
But the plague
Who is there?
The same, alas.
A lowly player.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
A literary feud. Quite normal.
You lie.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
I do not love you, my lord.
I will do my duty, my lord.
Does she say so?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
You are on my ground.
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I don't have time.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
He couldn't get his car started.
You call them if you want.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Is this necessary?
Just stop worrying.
Now.
There was a break-in.
We just wanted to speak to you.
This is just an informal discussion.
What?
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Not usually this drunk.
Yes.
Did what?
I'm just looking.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
I thought we all were.
OK.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
For ever and ever.
Who?
No, I don't.
That's not him.
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Your painful groin?
I'll wait there.
Alex.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
Of course.
Yes, absolutely.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
That wasn't a question.
Do you smoke?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Yes. They're my friends.
It was on the television.
You and me?
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What happened to that guy?
That guy, the one that died.
That's what I thought.
I'd be delighted.
A priest who dies.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
No.
And that's not the same thing?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
I mean, that's what it's like.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
That you were just indulging me.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
What are you talking about?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I don't want to place you in any position --
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Whatever you say.
Well she...
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
No.
I guess so.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hungry?
No thanks.
Gee, this is great.
I never get my hair done.
I am not!
Great.
Right.
They are?
Yeah.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Great.
Whew.
Yeah... wow.
And what?
Did I what?
You did, I know you did.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Jackie, can we --
You were great.
No you didn't.
You were great.
He never stopped.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
Look who's talking.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Wanda...
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- Oh yeah.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- why did you come in today?
-- how did you get here?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Where?
What's gonna happen?
Who?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Honey, what happened?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
Yeah, baby.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hello.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Okay.
I'll call you.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
What is.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
Yes.
I just want to know, that's all.
Did you?
Well, yeah.
I see.
You're right.
Oh, hey...
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Now wait a minute...
Oh Jesus Christ.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Didn't they tell you?
I know.
What about her?
Okay, okay...
A soap?
And?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Steve?
That's not very logical, Lester.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Jackie, what're you doing?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Who is that?
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
So what's your point?
Well, you know what I mean.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
Well, there was this one time --
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
Well... sure...
I don't think so.
Let's do that.
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
You're going.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- just wonderful.
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Yes?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
What do you mean?
Do they know he tell you things?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
What about Room 237?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay, Mom.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
All right.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Fine.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Good.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
Of course you are.
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
Wendy...
Yes?
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Not for me.
They'll love it.
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh...
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Royalty?
Oh!
Oh, I'll say.
How do you do?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
For getting a divorce?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
Yeah... sure.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
I think they hear you!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
You can handle this.
What did who say?
Vince...
Today was the deadline, Vince.
Yes?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Right.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Am I?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Mary Robert.
Tell me about it.
Amateurs 2
What?  What time is it?
Five a.m.?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She won't?  Why not?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Keep moving!
Give me a C.  A C!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Very well.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Would you like that?
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
No food?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Useless distractions.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
Then-you run.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
You're supposed to be hiding out!
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Really.
You won't even tell us?
It didn't happen.
Which one?
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Neither did you!
She's praying.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
It's brought people back to the church.
She wasn't a nun?
She's our inspiration!
Christy.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
... Brom Bones...
Bring him.
You will stay at her side?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Hmm?  See them?
I shall, gladly.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
How could he?
We should go.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I doubt that's the end.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What did you say?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Come with me.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
He moves too fast.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
That boy wants me to.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
French-fried potaters.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
It went real good.
Would y'all like that?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
I know Albert. We're friends.
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
What numbers do you punch?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I did live there in the state hospital.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I thought they was.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
All right then.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
He ain't no count.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
No sir.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
He ain't ever okay to me.
Mama?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I want to come back and stay here.
I reckon.
No ma'am.
I'll be dog.
Right now?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Ma'am?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
What's that you say?
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon not.
I've heard it said that way.
Can I help you, sir?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
No, we have to get this story.
Why won't he talk to women?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
American literature. What else?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Huh?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Eighteen and a half years.
You're looking good, Auggie.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Where to?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Five thousand bucks.
For keeps.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
What is this, some kind of joke?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
And these?
The refrigerator?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
And?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
It was just a thought.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
You can't be more specific than that?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Is your father an artist?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
You don't really want to know.
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
You work too hard, you know that?
The end.
His only copy?
Yeah, I picked it up.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
That money is my whole future.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Medium rare, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
Oh, yeh?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
And the last...?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection!  Speculation.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Won't take two.
You're right.  I better use two.
Yes, he was.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
I should show them an American?
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Not in those words.
That's all he said.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Such as?
Thank you ever so.
Fresh!
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
No we're not.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
Down, Daphne!
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Then pull the emergency brake!
I got pinched in the elevator.
And I'm not even pretty.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
But this is so humiliating.
You - you -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
That's right.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Have I got things to tell you!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
What?
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
I'm fine.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Come on, Daphne.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Yes.  For a whole year.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Bull fiddle.
Most of the time I slap it.
Who?
Sorry.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
And I can never have children.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
We won't breathe a word.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
No - funerals.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Where did he conduct?
I'm not very bright, I guess.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I'll say.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
About what?
What's in Florida?
Glasses?
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Good night, Sugar.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Not very likely.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
I beg your pardon?
What theory?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
What?
I am?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
It's the crews' night off.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Oh, no!
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Have you ever tried American girls?
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Big joke!
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
I sleep with my spats on.
Spats Colombo.
You don't owe me no nothing.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Jeffrey told her last night.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
She did?
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Yeah?
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
This happened to you?
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Make out with you for free.
Spontaneously combust?
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Is there any other way to take it?
You don't live around here, do you?
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
That's right--
Sure--
What's his name?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Yes, mam...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Hi, Daddy...
I think so...
Goodnight to you, son...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Yes mam...
Same as we -- they pray.
Children, come here...
You sure can, son...
Good night...
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
He can't get up, Mama!
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
I'm used to it.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Might be...
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
I wanta see Nathan.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Pillow.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Fragile?
I said -
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
How the fuck should I know!!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
No way.
No you can't Kenny!
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Something big, children.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
What?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!

KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I don't know.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
For pooping, silly.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah...
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Yeah, they suck.
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Right away, ma'am!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
I sure did, Phillip!!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I am.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Magnificent, magnificent.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
They are awaiting further information.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Will you shut up already?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
I don't know.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
So we did.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Words to live by.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I can't!
Barnes?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Over and out.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
I guess so.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
You're not from around here, are you?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Lemme see your ball.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Are you guys bruddas?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
No kiddin'.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
I'm not on the tour this year.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
She's my mom.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I got a right. You're my father.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What's it look like to you?
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I gotta survive.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Clam it!
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Buzz Fazeli.
Junior who?
I like the sport the way it is.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Look who's talking!
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Yippy!
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Mine, and they never tip.
I'm not here to - I can't...
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
So, what about you?
We'll get into that later.
Really? I kinda like it.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why not?
Are you sure he's dead?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Suck my dick!
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I'm not here to bowl.
It's burning...
How long will that be?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What if it attacks?
What do we use for defense?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
What team?
Take a look.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
What?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
How drastic?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?
Pull it.
Working on it now, sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Harry?  Can you copy?
Nothing, sir.
What the hell is going on here?
In a minute, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
It's not ignorant.
What is it?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
I love secrets.
Wait -- down where?
It never occurred to me.
Yeah.  Drowning.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?
Beth --
Beth.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What are they?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
Where did you get this?
You went through Edmunds' things?
Beth --
Why should I go?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
You think?
Manifested?
Antibiotic.
How do you spell it?
How's Harry?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
But I have to, Norman.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Just in time for what?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm fine.
What are you still doing here?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
What is it, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
How do we decode it?
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
You got her?
Nine hundred feet to surface.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Arrived?  From where?
Does this mean what I think it means?
The ships?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
What?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
I know that.
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
You mean I generate an energy field?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
Why?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
What an honor...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
What do I want with a scar ?
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
I'm getting better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Only when I give you an order.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Hey, check it.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Carl can wait.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I can't help it.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Hut... hut !
Sure.
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
You got it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
I won't quit !
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Courage, I guess.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Hi, mom.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Move out.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir !
The information will not be disclosed.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
That is how V'ger will survive.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
Decker....!
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Aye, sir.
Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead, sir.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
And whatever you sensed out here....
Any reply from them?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
The point... 
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Who?
What's it called?
Yes.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Yes...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
Everyday things...yes.
Surest thing you know.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
Well, first, you got to change the title...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
You got a paperclip?
Better idea...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Oh, God...
You going to ask me in?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You believe that?
Sure did.
I can't get it to come out right.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
You'd do the newspaper right here.
Yes...
Now you're talking...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Not without a rolltop desk.
I saw...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Morning, darling.
Yes, that's right.
What are they offering?
Who is this person that you've found?
What?
Hi.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Fifteen hands.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
I <u>know</u> my lines...
She's a...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Joe, the writer?
You mind...?
I'm ready!
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
The Mayor's outside.
Mr. Bailey.
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
But we...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
...yes...
We, we have to give it.
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Who got their heads cut?
Main Street.
Doug, this is Mr...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
How about that.
My wife just went into labor...
He should be put in jail.
You bet he did.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
Where have you been...?
I can write it.  I can't type it.
No.
I don't know.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
Like dykes and dogs.
Find the money.
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...the city council...
...it is?
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Givvem a cigarette...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Sex.  Of course.
What are you gonna talk about?
I'll be there for you.
Well.  It's for you.
Secret's safe with me.
Not with my mouth open.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
This is a joke, right?
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'll miss you so much.
See, I...
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
You think this is funny?
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Not use my words, please!
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
Alright starve.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
What honey?
Is that like Luigi's?
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Mom...?
Thursday's fine...
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Is your bad?
That's Rache's song!
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
How do you know?
So where are you?
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Every day.  More and more.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
But you're not <u>done</u>!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Remarried.  There is no move.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
You're WHERE?
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Just not to me.
WE are over.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
She was angry at herself.
Don't flatter yourself.
We can't live like that.
You're not dying.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Feeling the pressure?
Is that what he told you?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You weren't passing 'em out.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
You're the hip and fresh.
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
Jesus.
For what?
It's no biggie.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Well, they will be.
Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Maybe he's gay.
What if he is?
Oh.
Great to be here.
It was God's will.
We had to work. My family was poor.
No.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My Jesus…
For rape and murder.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
Nothing, I guess…
Got a lot of homework?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
What's tomorrow?
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK!
Sure, Dad.
Take off your top.
'Fuck me hard!'
Again!!
Oh, fine. How are you?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Hunh.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
He did?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Why? Are we going dancing?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Yeah?...
What happened?
Used to Filmore, used to.
Are you going to kill us?
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Shut up!
She's still alive.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
I'll let the senator tell you.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
If I don't get power up we are!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Moffo!
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
What?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
That's government property, Major.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Do you recognize my voice?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
That's right, sir.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Yes, sir.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
What?
Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
Call them every five miles.
Maximum ECM!
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
First safety.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
But who would be chosen?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't anymore.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, I guess.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Oh.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
The dude wants it.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Look.
She's in the van.
Buff...
Guess not.
Jeff! Let's go!
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Shit.
Buff is funny. God.
Alright, Pony!
I'm so burnt-out.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Glad it's okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Oh, you were there?
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Hi.
What'd he get you?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
We were?
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Funny shit, man.
Thank you.
Mm-mm.
Sooze wants to see him.
No.
What?
Yeah, fuck 'em.
That chick, Erica?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You don't know?
Will you just put the gun down?
That, that's Indian?
That's right.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Tim!
Yeah.
Us.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
No, no.
Yes, you do.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
So how's college?
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
You know what I'm saying?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Yeah.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Alright!
That was so great!
Mine too.
You done?
Yep.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
That's because I am.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
It's none of my business?
If you hit me...
I'm here.
Oh that's nice for you.
No car.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Sorry, Kansas...
Wayne Gretzky.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Y'think?
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Bullets.
You're kidding.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
But you're not married.
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
I hear she was a terror to work with.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
In a deep freeze.
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
What's wrong with it?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
Why, you sweet kid.
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
You're tough, all right.
It will?
Who's who?
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
You did.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
If you love me, Joe.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
It is not.  Get out.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Uh-huh.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I don't need a tuxedo.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Just follow me.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
"Mad about the boy."
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
No, they don't.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
But where?
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But which one?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Later.
You love me?
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Tell me where I can find her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
What's that?
But I don't understand.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I've got things to do.
Theories?
The scoop of the year!
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
I don't understand.
This is all your clothes?
It was just a trim.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
I knew it!
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Oh...I came close once.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Uh-huh.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Oh?
Mmmmm . . .
What's that?
At one o'clock in the morning?
What are you doing?
Yeah.
I know, I'm the fault.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
Uh...
Decaffeinated too?
Which country?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
They ain't got captains?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
I didn't have my camera with me.
Anytime.
We've already met.
You just did, with that great dinner.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Gus?
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
53!
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Why do I have to do this?
Hello.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
A normal person.
We can get to work on that oil!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Uh...home...
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
I'll be alright.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
Constantly.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Sentimental idiot.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
What about here?
Don't worry, I've got you.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
. . . Let me get my purse.
Clark. . . !
I'm sorry to see you go.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Absolutely!
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Stuff it.
Something . . . wonderful.
Our other dinner guest.
But why the hair?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
This wasn't in the plan.
Destiny.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
We're running out of smoke.
I've been on the job.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
North. It's north
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
Jealous? Of what?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Tough guy, huh?
You're on.
I didn't say a word.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You?! How about me?
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Tea?
Gets you where you live, huh?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All of us.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
He'll be weightless.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
There are none of them any good anyway.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Right on the first guess.
I came to talk to you.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Thirty-five.
What about it?
Uh-huh.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
They'll soon be over.
How are you?
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
She didn't.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Yeah.
Why?
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
Billy, that's too early.
Can't you make it later?
No.  It should be dry by now.
It's natural.
For rabbits?
Did his parents attend to that?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
It's interesting.
It's the truth.
What, Mason?
The people in the town?
Okay.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
You seem very sure about that.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
And what was the weather like at this time?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
There's the Prescots...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
Perfect.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Daddy?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
No.
You've been retained?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Excuse me?
No.
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Why were you scared?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
It's okay.
How will he do that?
As opposed to this T.V.?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Why?
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
J.J., Steve isn't...
No.  I'm going home.
Susan!...
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Can I come in for a minute?
I have a message from your sister.
You print them, don't you?
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
She knows now.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
But what?
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I'm used to you...
I know you do, Sidney.
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Why did you call me?
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
Liquid metal.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Why?
Why?
What?
Cool.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
No.
She intends to change the future somehow.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'm sorry, John.
I order you not to!
No!  Don't kill him!
Alright, it!  We need it!
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
And Skynet fights back.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
On all what?
Eating is eating... and...
Some.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Colonel. Pleasure.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
No. Ours was damaged.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
What is this, Emmi?
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never.  Never.
How could I forget?
Show you?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
So. You wanted to see me.
He did?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Who's he?
Yes.
Sure.
Jeez, and I never heard of him.
Like this bandleader.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
All.
Great.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
What about it?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
You must have had a fun child-
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Someone?
No.  Never.
Kyle...
Why?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Okay.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
I just called.
Like shit, boss.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I said I was sorry...
A game?
If there was one.
No.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Can we talk?
Is this you?
What's wrong?
Get out.
What are you talking about... ?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do we do?
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
We searched the house.
Fuck you.
Shut up!
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Like... where are you from?
Underwear?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
I said I would...
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Have you gone to the police?
Of course, Nick...
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It was a different floor then...
Have a nice day.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
You know you can.
Nothing else?
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Luke.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You could have.
All night?
Where in the hell can she be.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Nell.  You will come here now.
What?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
It's okay... we're all here...
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Why'd she kill herself?
Why would we --
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I know.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
No, it's getting worse.
I think so.
Then let's go get you one.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
What kind of food?
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
Who?
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Where do we go?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
There's been some trouble downtown.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Eduardo.  Rama.
No reason.
Huh?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Did Jenny know?
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
No one else is even here yet.
Not much -- you?
Uh-huh.
Probably.
Really.
Well, those are the breaks.
No, but I know what he means.
Not her brand.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Not ashamed.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
Something like that, yeah.
That's what was estimated.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Depends, don' it.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Up the coast.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Ian?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Where else?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
The forever kind.
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
Walked.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
What are you doing here?
Who's looking for you?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Ah.
I don't.
Be seein' you.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Birdy.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
...Uh-huh.
Huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
I don't understand.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
And how do we share--
I'll have it in a week.
Look, uh... Creighton...
How's business, Dave?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
But it's...
So you paid the guy?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Who?
How's that?
So?
Honey...
You don't have to--
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Honey...
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
It was Big Dave's.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Sure you don't need one?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah, yeah--go home.
What the--
That's very generous.
Crane. Ed Crane.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
I'm in.
Anything missin'?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
So the method of death is the only connection?
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Not so loud.
I'd say we're in its home.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
What are they?
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
We will.
Look who's here, Margo.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Yes.
Like this.
He's right.  Follow me.
Another storage room.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Frock's been fired.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
It's reptilian.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
Maybe not.
You loved him.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
It's scared of me.
Oh God!  Help!
<i>Fiji.</i>
One.
Amnesia.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
Now.
You think so?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
Gee, that's great.
I've been thinking--
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Good night, Mother.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I don't know--
Put some butter on it--or ice?
I won't be here Sunday.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
There's been an accident, Truman.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Do something...
Truman, stop it!
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Who?
There's no one here.
Yeah.
You're not FBI agents.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
There are complications.
Kurtzweil, we think.
You got some kind of business with him?
What's that?
No. Don't bother.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Show you right on a map.
Yeah, I did.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Not according to the men in blue.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
You can't.
I've been using you?!
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I'd been told as much.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't know, Mulder.
Mulder --
I have no idea.
I don't know.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Where's Scully?!
I want to know where Scully is.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
How?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
A pocketful of rye...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
No.
Yes mother.
Okay.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What's wrong?
As far as I needed.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
What happened to Charles Gish?
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yep.  Eloped.
No problem.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
What's wrong?
Sometime yesterday morning.
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Dr. Kent.
Completely unaware.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Now?
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
I don't have to.
Do you understand German?
No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
I was told there were only two men there.
Just another part I've got to learn.
What's that?
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
It's just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
I thought you wanted...
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
There's nothing in them.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
I don't want it.
No, not yet.
When did you see him last?
I can't say that I have.
What?
It wasn't petrol.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
A bruised lip.
Bring him in.
No.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Of course.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Goodness, that's awkward.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Why not?
As long as they can use you?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What do you want?
Yes.
I have guests waiting.
Must be some mistake.
Mr. Lime - yes.
You saw it?
Yes.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Now, hold on.
Well make it your business.
I am not a bad man.
Never.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
We moved rooms because of him.
One or two kilometers.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
It's on an island that no one get to.
You can swim?
Two.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
He's an asshole.
That's a movie, you moron.
Yes.
Why the fuck not?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
You want it to be an event.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
Why?
What assholes.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
I told you, I'm good at this.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
I agree.
A poison...?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Notice? Like what...?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Female...
Of course they're Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
The arguments, anyway.
A forty-five.
I can't say that.
You do it on the inside....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
From the Rhineland originally.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
That's meat.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
Steve...
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
You said they didn't have night guards.
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
JTS...?
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Get out of my way.
I can tell....
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
No.
Funny?
He was funny.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Eat shit....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
No.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
In a lake.
Congratulations.
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Okay.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Enzo!
You know what I'm talking about.
Lira?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
I didn't say...  Brussels!
Fine!
No...
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
We saw each other a little while ago.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I don't know... why?
Thank you...
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Anything.
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
What?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Louis, we were French!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Why is he doing this?
... Yes?
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
C'mon follow me.
Yes Esther.
Mordechai!
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
He's still working out some identity issues.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Worse.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
That depends. How much money has he?
I don't know —-
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No. I'm serious about this.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Charlie likes his leopard.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Just barely possible - - yes.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
I know. Funerals.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
We will ——
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
You’re mad...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
My brother hung himself.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
You bastard...
...We’re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Here we go again.
Simplify and damn.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Croissants. Like that...
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I’m fine standing, thank you.
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
Yeah.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There’s a lot of people back there. They’re holding a seminar. Trafficking’s the past, breeding the future...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Tomorrow?
I see. How much?
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
What?
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
I’ll call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I certainly did, sir...
No.
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
My rates...
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Jah...
Is my money in there?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Shut up and drive!
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
Should I come back in five minutes?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Good reasons?
... No.
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Excuse me?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Où est passé ton salon?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
What do you think, huh?
It’s a good guess...
Of course I am, it's just that...
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Well...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
But it is what I want.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I -- I don't understand...
Sound the retreat...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
I don't remember.  Maybe.
I don't know...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
We want her burned as a witch!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Where... where am I?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Not long ago...
Last night.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
And may I go to Mass?
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I understand.  How much?
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
His face.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Yes... they were.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Me too...
No... not like this...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No...!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I -- I -- I...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
What do you mean, they won't come?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
I need to confess again.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
Just over a year.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
What?
Thanks.
I haven't seen him.
Tough luck.
It costs.
Who's recruiting?
Yes, please.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Just shut up.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You'll be deported.
So, what's the news?
There are always notices going up.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
God forbid!
Stop it, Wladek.
Sorry, I don't remember.
We're getting out.
Yes, like a cave.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
That is good, yes.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
No.
I just want to listen.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
You've missed this bit.
Tomorrow.
What will I play?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
Billie.  You ready?
Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
What?
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
I'm busy, Floyd.
They workin' for anybody?
Who's got the contract?
Hackers.
What do ya want the others to get?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
I picked something up on the way.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You know anything about him?
If we ever get to it.
Yeh, it was easy.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
I also gotta win.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
Pass.
Raise 500.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
No.
All right, when?
Okay, Tootsie.
He cheats.
Yeh, he knows that.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Don't think I know him.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Never heard of the place.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
You know how they are... sex...
It's all right.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
He's just around the corner.
Said he stole his invention.
You've got to get your mind off this.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Nothing.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't.
He wouldn't say.
Yes.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Macaulay.
tried him once -
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, thank heaven.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
You see how much we have to say.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
If you think it'll be all right.
It's a promise?
And he still wants to marry me!
I'm very interested in that body.
She could tell you where father is.
We were looking for this bird.
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
You mean about that gun?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What do you mean?
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Well, what?
When was that?
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
You've said that for weeks.
Never mind.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Well, don't you?
Yes...
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Oh, this is Andy --
Much better, thanks.
Six Martinis.
What are you drinking?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Someone get a doctor.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
I don't know.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Goodbye, darling.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
He was down in the shop.
Couple of months anyway.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
It's the only way it makes sense.
Yes.  Nick!
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Y-yes.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
You just go when I say go.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Maybe we should split it up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You don't know that.
He's an enemy soldier.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
Knock it off!
OH MY GOD!
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I heard it click.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They can't shoot us in here.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
What?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
You still got a map on you?
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
We go this way.
When did you make the switch?
But...
Then I'm a rich man.
What?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
What?
Really?
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Oh, God!
Yeah, well, we're not.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
He lived through that?
Correct.  Origin?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
You've seen enough.
Looks like dirt.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
But...you...
AH UGH.
No!...No!...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
We're leaving.
THX and me.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
I don't feel well.
What?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
All right...
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
Officer Reilly, vice.
-Where?
Go ahead.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Look, it's a longshot...
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Off the scale.
Nothing.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Hey, I'm next.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Helluva fuck factor.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
People are dying.
Security.
What? Nobody, I-
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Nothing so far.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Yeah, just a nick ...
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Goddamit, Reilly--
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
No!
About tonsils.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Constantinople?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Why should you?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Certainly!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily!
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
I know that niche.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Oh! You didn't read it!
M'sieu Laval!
Too much blue in crimson.
Peaches and cream.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
No. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
Right!
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Talk? About me--about us?
Like that?
Yes, Gaston?
I don't believe it!
I know!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Well--uh--yes and no.
The pumps --
Thank you, Rose.
The ship will sink.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Don't you mean work me?
Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
Rose Calvert.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
I was tired.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Sure. Count me in.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
No, but we're making excellent time.
Excuse me.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
I see you.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
He couldn't have.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Get in the boat, Rose.
It's so cold.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
Baloney!
Glad to see you again.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
<U>Gladly</U>.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
And me coming in with two pair-- 
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Well, I can't.
Okay.
Lonesome?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Lose?--I won a little--
What do you know about them?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
I'll watch for him, sir.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
I'll take one. 
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Thanks. That makes us square.
She did?
In New York.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Send that.
O.K.! Send that!
So what?
Well, did you find me?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Miss Marsh.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Very serious?
What do you mean?
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
The country boy's about due.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I sincerely hope so--
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Then why did you run away?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Absolutely nothing.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Well I'm not so go home.
Come and get him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Well... 'bye.
But wait, you don't understand-
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Yeah, you look it.
Here it come: one-two-
Enough?  Never.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
I'll remember you said that.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
How you feelin', Doc?
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
What?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
How is he?
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
You'd die for fun?
How would you know?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
I'll be damned...
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Morg, use your head.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
I know, I need a keeper.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Wyatt...
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
I see.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
So why did you leave?
And still not a thing to watch.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
What about the gold?
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Where can I find him?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Nothing.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Three. You? Married?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
He was my father's best friend!
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
If not?
I didn't say when I want to die -
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Now.
Yes, M.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Good luck on your mission, 007.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
You leave me no alternative.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Excellent.
...I see.
Approaching the first gate.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
It is just a regular card.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
No, I'm too hot now.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
What happened to your hand?
It's healing now.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
I'll be right there.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
But Mom, I can't find him!
But what if we leave them behind?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Watch yourself!!
Excuse me.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Where?
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
You mean that happy child?
Trouble?!  Where?!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Shield your eyes!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Don't tell me what to do!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Yeah, right.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
I got dibs on his hat!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
A lunchbox...?!
Alright!  That's it!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Yes SIR!
Last present!
Huh?
Got it.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Slink!  Hang on!
But you're Irish!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
Is that all?
Can you move over a wee bit?
Did you now.
Nothing is left but us.
Juliet who?
You're late for breakfast.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, this is crazy.
What is he being charged with?
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
That's frustrating.
Me, too.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Barbara --
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
So's the video camera.
Honey, your father knows the President.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
I don't know.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Cincinnati Country Day.
I get A's.  All A's.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What is this, like freebase?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
I feel good.
Nope.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
I don't know.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
That thought makes me feel awful.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I don't believe you.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
The police won't find your car.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
No.
Javier Rodriguez.
If I can.
It's possible.
Noriega is a criminal.
Any way we can do it better?
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
What kind of research?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
I'd fucking kill you.
Thanks.
What?
Eh-
Right. You can't sleep here.
Because it's illegal.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Yeah.
Another dab?
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Despite the Academy award?
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Fuck you.
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
We're two thousand short.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your usual table, sir?
Such as?
Are you serious?
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
No joy yet.
Went ballistic?
But where?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Oh, please.
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
Who is it he reminds you of?
I did not.
I have a half brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
That's a little vague, Spock -
"c."... "k."
Hmmm?
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I'm afraid of nothing.


Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
No. I will not.
You invented Space Paranoids?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
To warn him.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
End of line.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Greetings, program...
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Why? What are you going to do?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Recognizers!
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Come here.
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
You're getting out of the business?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It's something Users do.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Yeah, Dad.
Yeah, right.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
Why?
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
What?
What?
No way.  Not Dana.
In her dreams.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
I still don't believe it.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
No!  Never!
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes, sir.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Me too.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
He needed my help.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
Dance?
Absolutely.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I'm sorry, I can't.
What is it you need me to do?
I'm married!
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Hello, Alabama.
This is great, we got cable.
Don't eat anything.
Ya looked through it?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
The oriental.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What do you do?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You didn't do nothing.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
My pimp.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
What?
Heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Tomorrow.
Get the fuck outta here!
Now tell him goodbye.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I know.
Yeah?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Look, Dick, I don't -
What department?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
No. No you're not.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
That's about all I ever eat.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
You were a cop.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
No shit?
I got some money I can give you -
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
No.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Sure. No problem.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Not a tiny little vial -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
How the fuck could he know?
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Donowitz, he said.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Underground.
I have to go.
No, 1995 is the past.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
I've got one now.
Jeffrey Mason?
What's the matter with your leg?
You have to give yourself up, you know.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
You're sure?
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
I need to make a telephone call.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
How did you find me?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I'll be right here...just in case.
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
More or less.
Same back at you.
Will be.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It is not.
How much.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
So?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
My cup runneth over, beauti--
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Like they're made of polyester.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
I can't.
Where?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
What about us?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Give him the money.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Now what?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
I'm here.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Like you don't know.
No.
I was hoping we could talk.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
No.
Trouble with the car again?
You came to take my wife from me?
Christ, Jake, please--
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
For what?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Sure, Sheriff.
What for?
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Who the hell are you?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Like you don't know.
I was hoping we could talk.
You love her, but you hate her?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Nope.  Darrell.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Don't look like nothing.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's Grace.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Come here.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
No.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
My mother died in this canyon.
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
Sure, I'll try.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Yes. Is this David?
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
You assumed wrong.
You've misunderstood.
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
But not a knife?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one--
No.
No.
Jeremy listen to what--
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Is David Dunne there?
No.
How long have you been married?
How did you get together?
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
No?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
We was... lyin'.
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
She back in Kansas?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Is... is it... loaded?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Oh.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Lookin' at?
What happened, did you hit him?
Yeah.
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
Yeah.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
You ain't shot.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Two.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
He's blind, for Chri...
Yeah.
An' if I spot 'em?
Just like that?
Bear with me here...
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Then who goes?
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
What do you care what he says?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Tough break.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Not if we do it my way.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Neither do we.
We'll see.
You're lying.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
I shivved him.
Business or personal?
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
You didn't know.
Two hours, tops.
What?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Kobayashi.
I know he was good.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
He didn't have my lawyer.
I'm not a rat.
He loved her.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
What lawyer?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
I don't.
I never heard of him.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Yes.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Yes.
When she...
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
I am seventy-four years old.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
I...
I completely understand ...
Hold on a second.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
'Code Blue'...
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
Yes.  I wrote it.
Why?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
And ask me what?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
From the magazine?
Kathy Price.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Maybe what?
What...?
Yes.
It's over!
Stop pressuring me...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I'm swell.
Yeah.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
... You saw her?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
In New York?
Hi.  How are you doing?
Mrs...
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
As I've said we had some more...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Should I?
Me, too.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
No.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
There are things you didn't tell me.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Did she hurt herself?
What for? Who are you?
Who you are --
Because I remind you of her?
Can I see you tomorrow?
No.
No.
No, it's not right.
They're none of them right.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
You can.
Oh, yeah. There.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
No! Let me go!
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
What are you going to do?
I loved you, Madeleine.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
You've nothing to apologize for.
I enjoyed talking to you.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
What?
Good-bye.
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Knowing I have to die...
The tall trees...
I know.
Why? What's happened?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Too late... there's something I must do...
To the church, I must go there.
Why?
Please answer my question.
How long has she had the room?
Would you please go and look?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I've never run across one like that.
Normal.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
I'll take you home.
Carlotta?
Oh?
Oh... this and that.
Wandering.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What is it, a still life?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What did you say?
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Multiple reasons.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
There's more.
What about the blood?
I am not flexible on this.
They're driving me nuts!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
What.
I don't think so.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Well, oh...
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Left side.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Shut up Boyd.
What is the question you asked me?
What you just said. Say it again.
What does that mean?
Fine? Fine what?
Not a prayer.
You need help.
And what happens when you can't?
What? What's your point?
We're not goosed.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Goosed!
Goosed!
I love you.
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
Government cutbacks.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Yup.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Well it's bad timing.
What are you talking about?
Why? What's his problem?
Okay.
I'm not. What's the problem?
I'll call them from the road.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
I'm mad at you.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Now?
Micheal, by accident.
What does that mean?
Go for it.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
The wahoo?
I think so.
I got to agree with that.
My God...
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
Yup.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
What song?
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Drum banging real times.
That's right.
You'd like me to kill them?
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Two.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
What's that?
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Come down.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Evil.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Go away! Leave me alone.
What's the matter?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
Why?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
Are you Jorge?
If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Stop this!
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Why wasn't I told?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
I'm still working on it.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
Stop me.
This isn't a game, Parker!
I'm doing the best I can!
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Both.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Part of him is.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
...I think so...You?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
For Schumann.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand...

Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
...can we have a white one...?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
...twelve years.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
Who's got the story? 
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll see you at National.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
In the yellow ribbon.
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
...fourteen years...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Heavy weather East of here.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
All the greater accomplishment.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
A proud tradition.
I'm looking for a phone...
Watch me.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
It's a <u>beret</u>...
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
Yes.
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...of kittens...
...for the beans, yes...
Show some compassion.
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Oh really.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
Alright. Why so pissed?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
You speak for me, son.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
We are?
So you're hot on this stock?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Jackson, Steinem...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
What makes you think you can?
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
How much is enough Gordon?
Obviously...
Dump it.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Upper West Side.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You got it, G.G.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Thank you Jenkins
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Who's is all this?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Hi there Sarah
Well divide 18 into three
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
No, he wouldn't.
A ghost?
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Have you been hurt?
Who's that?
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
I'm not...
Who?  Your husband?
You do?
And then you weren't there.
Very much.
Thank you.
What?
Yeah.
Please leave me alone.
She never mentioned her father.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Do we have to?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Jody, no...
I don't...
M-E...
I think so
It's alright.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Did I?
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
No.
If she was dangerous before--
Like what?
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Yep.
Nice.  Almost done.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
I am, really.
You are...
Tomorrow.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Is it gone?
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
In the house.  I was scared.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Huh.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Claire, please...
Then where is she?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Yep.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
Not personally.
Wouldn't go that far.
What?
Get out of my way.
How did she know where it was?
Huh.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Well, they are.
Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Michael, Rowan should -
Every day  twice.
I want to see my mother.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Then you wear it.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
It wes a dream...!
Stop it!
ENOUGH!!!
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
FAST.
Like this...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
If you knew how I yearn for that...
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
And whose houses do you design...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...

What about you coming down here...?
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
That's GREAT!
A little wine...?
Mm-hmm...
I love you too.
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
If you like that type.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
You really love this guy...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Papers...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
BRIAN...
That's right...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - not all the time - I mean
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I'm sorry?
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
Yes, one and a half please.
You don't know?
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Out - I may be some time
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
You killed my friend!
At 2.00...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
Yes I can...
What's this all about?
Yes - of course.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
Perv.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
But that smile.
So that's a maybe?
Which you pulled, hard!
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
It's okay. You need me?
You ordered a Winnebago?
That's me.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
You want it in writing?
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
He didn't. He had it built.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Very ambitious. I like that.
You better.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Only the best for my mother.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
Me? The King of Coitus?
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
You think we should be more open minded?
Really? So I'm doing OK?
He was in a league of his own.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
People pay good money for that?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
He was large?
No.
Back to the land of grownups.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
Unless what?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
You could say that.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
What about witnesses?
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Just tell us what happened.
Yeah... okay... he did
What?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
Yes.  God, Mom...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
I won't.
So you got my mom's money.
That's not your line.
I love you.  Now give me the line.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Just like that?
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You got something against cigarettes?
That's cop bullshit.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Hi, Sandy.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Goodbye, Sandra.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Aha?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Where have you been?
You tell me.
I've had some practice.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Yes sir.
Nicely said, sir.
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
No, sir... just a businessman.
I deal with some tough customers.
That would be... the Mexican War?
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
They're coming.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
Me?
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Let me see it.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
I will!  But I need help!
As above, so below.
Why.
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Where the hell did you come from?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Ahhh!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Burn it to a fine ash.
The limitless power of...
There's nobody here.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
I changed her already!
Who is he?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who??
Cows. You know, cows?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
John, I don't understand any of this.
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
No pistol. Ever.
Oh, he's good.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Johnny –
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Home.
Only the elders.
What?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I'm going this morning.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
Not long... A few days.
I know.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
I didn't even know about it.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
His name is John Book.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Oh -- all right.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Is morally, ethic'ly
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
How did you guess?
No, they won't - honestly.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh! Oh!
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
Huh?  What'd he say?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Ohhh --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
They would?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes -- that's true.
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
It's too late!  There they....
Who at?
What's the matter?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Now...
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Imposserous!
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
You mean she bit you?
No, sir!
To Oz!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Dorothy!
It's a whozis?
We'll get you together!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Like riding a bike.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
I took the initiative.
Who did you get it from?
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Yes.
Yes.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
No. You’ll be safe here.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He used your exact words.
Soon she’ll be everywhere.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
Where did you get this?
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Could...could you come?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Washington?
Don't call me that.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Jon, no -- I can't --
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Veidt¹s complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What if you¹re wrong??
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
What are you up to?
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Janey, will you marry me?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names!
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Maybe I'll do that.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Ever see one of these before?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Looks like a diner.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
The scum of the Earth.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
"Anarchy" 99"?
What weapons do you have?
He gets to be the hero.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
We hung out last night, remember?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
I'm through, Xander.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Is this what you're looking for?
Been to any good diners lately?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
This is a gift. From me to you.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
I don't like him being here.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
It's too far.
I wanted to talk to you.
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
Not interested.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
What do you want?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
How?
Enough for a test.
What do you want with him?
What do you mean to do?
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
MMmmm.
Yes.
Goodbye, darling.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Yes!... the laboratory.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
How do you do?
What wockers?
Just putting up some tea.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Why?
This guy means business.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Who are you talking to?
It wasn't me.
I'm not trying to be funny.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Can you play it?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
It's the only way.
It's alive!
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
And look at this, Doctor!
Stop -- singing!!!
Good night!
I see what you mean.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
MMmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Food!!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
But will they make good use of them?
Certainly, Sin
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Which one?
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
