There.
You got something on your mind?
But
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Where've you been?
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
But
That's not
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
That I'm used to.
Who is she?
What about him?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
What've you got for me?
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
You makin' any headway?
Where ya goin?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
A hundred bucks a date.
It's about time.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Nope - just came by to chat
You and Verona?
What's this?
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You think this'll work?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Why?
Why'd you let him get to you?
And I'm in control of it.
No, you weren't
Start a band?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Put your right foot there --
Then you screwed up
State trooper?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
As a parent, that's my right
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
You think?
What plan?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
What does he say?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
To bring the word of God.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
God... That's in a week!
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
How can you be so certain?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
The ocean is uncrossable?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
What's he doing?
... Into a monk...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Back in the Czech Republic?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
Is he your boyfriend?
Do you have coffee?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
I'm gonna propose.
What's he looking for?
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Are you hit?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Hmmmm.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Are you married?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Two weeks.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious.
Emil???!
I can get you a job.
It's easy to learn.
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I know.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
What was that?
Well, he killed my partner!
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE

It's about my salary cheques.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Oh?
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Well, that's something.
Two more.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
CONINUED
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Thank you.
What do you mean?
I see.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Roger.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
This is three years old.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
You're in a hurry.
How about it?
Where's ganz?
You got a name, cop?
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Hey, you wanna bet?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Half a million.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Where's the money?
Where's the goddamn car?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
No class...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
We missed.
Yeah, I see her.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Hey, there she is...
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
No wonder you're so popular.
Hey, I don't believe it.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
They all like this in your family, father?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Of course.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I don't have time... I need to know.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
...What's your name?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
You know how to fly this thing?
To save the world.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
...Shit!
Here we go again...
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
This is all that survived?
Talk English Doc.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
What are you talking about?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Excellent.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
I figured you share information.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Celebrity Films.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Who is Machine?
How much did he pay you?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Do it.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
You are a private investigator?
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Truman Capote.
How long you been working there?
I'm not a cop.
How old are you?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
He's odd.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
He succeeded.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
You don't have any other choice.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Yes... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
What was she running from?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I didn't mean to...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
How... how can you say that to me...?
What are you talking about... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Rick...I can't.
You alright?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
We'll figure it out.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Then you saw him, too?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
You look great!
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
Enough of that crap.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
How was the meeting?
Very funny.
You disappointed in me?
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Are you alright?
What?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
I don't understand.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You, too?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
We're stuck tight!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What about down?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
What do you think?
That's a <u>face</u>???
See what?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Are you alright, Wade?
Who?
You don't believe me?
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
I plan to. Soon.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Guaranteed, eh?
I used to play ball.
Double A. New Britain.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You stayed away?
Where'd you get the blood?
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
It's pretty old.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Something bugging you?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
The key, Wade.
Lillian!
It's just...
See. Get your boots.
Good. Who?
You okay?
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Which is?
Then who shot him?
I don't know. You tell me.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
May I speak to you for a moment?
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
Yeah, right.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Oveur.
Dunn.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Do you want to talk about it.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Both pilots!
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Can't you take a guess?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Rain.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
But Ted, you're the only...
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Yes?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
In there.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Who said that?
Back off, George.
Screw you.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
She's going to divorce me.
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?

With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
No.  There's no way!
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
That the atmosphere processor?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
What is it?
Yes, Hicks?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
We got problems.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
They're in the approach corridor.
They'll get us.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Range twenty meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
Cross my heart.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
No, it's different, honey.
Yes.  A little girl.
Don't go!  Please.
Burke!  Open the door!
Can we dream?
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Maestro.
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
What's that?
Oh!
What does he look like?
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
Is she a good fuck?
And how will you make him keep it?
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Stop it!
No! No! No!
Do you think that's funny?
No, I'm not playing this game.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tish-I'm-tee.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Yes!
What's the matter with you?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Wolfi!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Who was that?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Then he didn't send you?
I see.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
When, may I ask?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
He's adorable!
Hey!
Behold!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
Why are you here?
It couldn't be better.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Is he working?
Well?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
How could I not?
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
With all my heart, Mozart.
I have come to commission work from you.
Where is your wife?
Who?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Do you believe in it?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
And that's it. Do you have it?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
You mean in Turkey?
No, but I'm the best.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
Leave me alone.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
All Vienna has heard that.
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
What?
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
He's setting that play to music?
Where?
What anger?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
And what else?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
It wasn't a lunatic.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
What do you dream about?
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
The kitchen.
The bedroom.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David, what are you doing?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No what?
He all right?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Well, I like it here.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Okay.
Nice looking group.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
No, but he was on the moors.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
Thanks a lot.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm going completely crazy.
It's you, David.
Jack, are you really dead?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
Yes?
Sorry, love.
Do you have any hot soup?
No, thank you.
I don't rightly know, sir.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
He has?
Yeah.
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
What's the matter, Charlie?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Fifty thousand dollars!
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
know, but—
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Why are you so anxious?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Much better this morning, thank you.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Mr. Dickson?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
The ten dollars.
Oh, Matt . . .
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Dude Finlay?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
So you were home last night?
What time did you get in?
You can ride like that?
This is healing?
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
I ain't done --
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Damn!
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
How?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Distracting enough for you?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
That would have made an impression.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
That just might work.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
You've killed your fair share of men.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
That he was.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
But still died.
Jesse, is that your hand?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Yep.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Zee.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Mmm.
Was it worth it?
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Now let's have a drink.
I like that.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
... too young for whisky...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
Parker.
What is that?
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
So he's won.
What the hell is that sound?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
J&B. Straight.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
We should do it.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
Why? What's wrong?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Where are you going?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Can I help you?
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
SHUT UP!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
What's that, a gram?
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Anywhere you want?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
...to the office this afternoon.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
She's my...cousin.
Who?
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
You sure?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
He had a yacht?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
That's so typical, isn't it?
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
You don't wanna move, do you?
It's important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
...But?
What!
They hack into people's programs?
I can't just walk away!
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Look at this.
You look beautiful.
Milo?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Milo?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
My goodness.
You're living here?
That's gotta kill him, right?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
'Think I should buy some originals?
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
It's okay. Really.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
You could've handwritten it.
This is good. Who did it?
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
What're we looking for?
Come with me.
You know mine.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Were you?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
...Milo?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Time?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
I don't know --
Why were you so careless?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
...He knows.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
What is it?
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Who're these guys?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Yes.
Yes?
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Carnies.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
What's wrong with your hand?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
My wedding tackle.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Let's go get him!
Why?
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I can't. You're drunk.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Hello, luv.
Who?
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I love you, Austin.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Noooooooooooooo!
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
How's Austin?
What about his teeth?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Secret ...
Fear ...
How long have I been here?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
I resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I didn't. Mother did.
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
I thought you played by the rules.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Where's Mother?
You don't believe him?
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Steed
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
No, please! I beg you ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Rules are made to be broken.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
What do you mean?
That's what we're going to find out...
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
All right!
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Cole?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Great bathing suit.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Let's go.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
Are any of those right?
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
The end.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
You've been having strange sex...!
Mrs.?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
He look familiar?
What are you going to do about it?
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Oh these moments do try me...
Biggest in two battalions.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Did you do it for Tim?
You gotta let me finish --
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Ya love it, probie?
You okay?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
...Not now, Brian.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I'll handle it.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Huh.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Hey.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I was doing my job.
I don't know anything about it.
What is --
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I need another one, sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Read.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You want some coffee?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
Alderman Swayzak.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
So what are you doing here?
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Everybody say Ho!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
De-la-croix.
No offense.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I won't do it anymore.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
The name of the show?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
This has to be a big mistake.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
So what's up with you?
He never showed it.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
I'm in till the end.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
You've said that already.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
For what?
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
Why'd you do that?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Yes, your name?
No joke.  Serious.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
How did you get this gig?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
To come back to our roots.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Not her, the one with the little...
...not that time...
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Then you yield to me.
Never.
Not one.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
You want my heart?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Will we always leave it at this?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Does this assignment interest you?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
He loves me, as I love you.
Can I at least have a drink?
I don't want to go --
What about Pike?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
I don't know... I like the Army.
You did Basic here?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
Cadet, what's your name!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
You know it's not like that --
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Full clip to the body --
I... I don't know...
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Nevertheless --
I'm sorry, Bill.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
Hostile and uncooperative.
He's in interrogation?
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
Baseball?
You made me look like an idiot --
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Buttfucks the cabin?
I pushed him too hard.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Think it'll work?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
Pike and I got separated --
We just want --
He said what?
But you didn't see it, right?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
You get the eye?
How long have you known my father?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Really.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Okay.
What did she say?
You're not trying to run away?
Jesus Christ.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
She was a witch.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Dad!
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Let's get out of here.
It's unbelievable.
I'm sorry.
You don't even know me.
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
How did you know my father?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I'm going to check on him.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
It's bad.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Was she one of your teachers?
That really happened?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
You first.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
The sets were good.
It's enough isn't it?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
What?
You can see why it's sensitive?
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Right.
Binoculars.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Today is bath day.
"Frenzy".
In every sense. If at all possible.
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Excuse me?
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't hate you.
And who says what is wrong.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You are throwing me out.
I don't have nothing.
What happened between you and the blonde?
I'm sorry.
What?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Okay. Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Goodbye.
It's not mine.
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
What are you doing?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
For your hands?
Holy shit.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
The fuck you laughin' at?
You wanna go home?
Better?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
YOU SHUT UP!
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Want another?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Tell me what to do.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Sorry.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
How a girl get like that?
Why's his britches round his knees?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Heard about this morning.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
You got any money?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
What are you doing?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Let's go.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
You'll take care of that.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Nick!
What happened?
I've continued working on the case!
Know her?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Nick --
Where does this Sugai live?
I want to go talk to him.
No...
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Thank you.  You have one?
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
I don't remember saying yes.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
I still think you're a bastard.
She's such a long way home for you.
It's not your job.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Because I want you to tell me.
What's this?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
You had my help, detective.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
Good.
That wasn't our deal.
What's the point?
Would you like to be modified?
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
He could?
Where are you going, Sebastian?
I didn't like her.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Okay, but...
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Vodka!
Those cockroaches?
I like you.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
What's that?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You're going to be over the limit.
Why didn't you go?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What shows?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It's artificial?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is there anything else?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
Who is this?
Where is he?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
But then how can you...
You're sick, Deckard.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Where the hell you been?
May I ask a personal question?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
What?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
How come you were in my truck?
Where are your folks?
Beautiful.
Twenty.
Bravo!
Your mom was a dancer?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Please excuse this interruption.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Get out of here!
No, I'm lost.
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
Again.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
It's Perry!
Why are you doing that?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Thank-Q!
Watching television in color.
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
What's fair?
Wait! Wait!
Thank you.
Then forget it.
They're all divorced?
It didn't used to be that way.
When do you need her by?
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
In the house?
About clothing?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
No!  Not crazy!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Okay. I like that.
That's ridiculous.
What?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm leaving, too.
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Hi, Eve!
No.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
What's baseball?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
But, I don't understand.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
You have very nice ceilings.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
It's so small.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
Yes. He likes windows.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
The recovery is very impressive.
What?!
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
Does that work?
Twenty-five? Around there.
Hello.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Yes?
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
Well, where are you --
Oh, my God!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Good god.
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
It shuts off automatically.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Yes!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
If we still have one.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
So where is your roommate, the model?
Stop it, you two!
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Alright, I will.
Well, what do you think?
Just be yourself.
What's it to you?!
Where are you going?
To bed?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Gay.
What's wrong?
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Buy it from me?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Jeffrey?
Okay?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Yes.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
I want you to hurt me.
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
What?
Frank gone?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
What are you lookin' at?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What?
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah, how did you know?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
What's the plan.
That sounds good.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah?
Okay, be careful.
Okay, okay.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
Okay.
My father has a gun at home.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
I need Il Duce.
Are ya ready?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
What the fuck are you doing?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Yeah, we promise.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Who the...
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Roc. You okay?
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Yes.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Continue the joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
There's another stocker, right?
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
Why not?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
I'll just say it.
OK. Go ahead.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
He needs to hire an attorney.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
He's gone. He stole the car.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
I'm not. But there's --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
I want you to look at this.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. As a girl.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
What are you doing?
There's not enough time.
Like amnesia.
Why?
You're living on a sailboat?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
That's a sharp jacket.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
We're renegades from despair.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Are you serious?
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Let's not even talk about it.
You OK, Bob?
Yeah.
Were you born in Mexico?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
OK, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What are you doing?
What happened?
This is natural.
How much is there?
Way to go, Bob!
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
That could be anybody's.
Yes, I do.
Bob, you're lying!
Do they let you --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
Is he in?
The grammar?
Is he good?
What's the story?
We're closed, sir.
He left his sweater.
I don't know.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
How's the weather down there?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
And what are we looking for?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Let's talk about Conklin.
I want to know what happened.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
And Bourne? Where's he now?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Sit down.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
She say what time I should call?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Show me again...
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You still should've moved.
What do you want?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Who sent you to Greece?
I'll get the book.
-- it hasn't been two years --
You drive.
-- it's just him? --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Abbott?
My first job.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
You're sure?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Still...
How long have you worked for the agency?
Believed what?
Did you?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Yes. In that order.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
But... what will you do?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
No, M'lord.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
I don't want to be a martyr.
That's just a dream, William!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I have faced him. Have you?
Treason. Against whom?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Thank you for accepting.
I want... to marry you!
Then when?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
What?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Anything.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Why do you ask?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Just. Like. Jason.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Get out. Both of you.
Oh God... what did we do?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I just thought you should know.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
I was?
I don't get it.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
What the hell are you doing?
Meant no offense.
Lenny? Come on!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
I should have known.
You want my advice?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
A franc for your thoughts.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please.
I didn't count the days.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Our faithful friend is still there.
Yes?
Did he give any reason?
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
How do you do?
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Well, this might come in handy.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
You will give us the names?
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
It was a combination of all three.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Manages what?
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Sam's piano.
I have. Sit down over there.
Uh huh.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Are my eyes really brown?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What's so damn funny?
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
Hey, look at you.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
"We're" not over-reacting.
That's your dog.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Get back?  From where?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
If you say you are.
Need some help?
You're Chuck Noland.
What happened to your pants?
Kamal is not here.
I was making a point.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Cool ropes.
That's all there is.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
What's she so emotional about?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
People watched the movies in their cars?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
At least you were never lonely.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
*What* will be okay?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Did you bite it?
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
What kind of plane are you flying?
Liberator...
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
It looks like scurvy.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Do you like to read?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
But you don't look very happy.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
So, what do you do?
Silicon Valley?
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We had to finalize the deal.
This has to happen fast.
Ten percent. Of how much?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
The Anti-Christ?
I can see why you liked her.
Nice.
Like what?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
We were back on.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
We'll take care of it.
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You can't cheat an honest man.
Why not?
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Why?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Oh Jesus!
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
Uh... Everything okay?
He's gone.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Do you have something to prove?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
Sorry. I didn't know...
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
We're working for the King.
Uh...
Him.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
What happened?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
So what do you want?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Did he buy it?
Who?
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
It's just insurance.
I'm Bella.
You're shaking.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Ouch.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
Three years, two months. March '93.
All right. As what?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
And your lady?
I couldn't resist them.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
You're shaking. What is it?
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
The door, Jack.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
I've lived there.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Toss you for it.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
He doesn't gamble.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
I owe a lot of money.
I know that. But you can now.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want you to forget what I said.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Would you like a drink?
How are you?
Of course I recognised him!
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Does Bella come here?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
That hair will have to go.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
What was that, I didn't hear...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
It is intuitively obvious.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
So if you detonate in...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Veil nebula.
TALBY!
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Oh yeah?
Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
No wire.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Who's Camille?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Can I say something in my defense?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
I'll make it worth your while.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Soon, baby.
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
Girlfriend?
Bent.
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
The other one like you...
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
I need to talk to her.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
None.
What do you want?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
No.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Please...
Make the call.
Playing hooky again?
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
Does this person have a name?
A toy?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
True, but--
What about this?
Huh?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Pick a song, Hawk.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
No problem.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No... You don't think...?
Dude, this is all I got.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Jam, listen up.
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Oh, hi, mom.
They're not idiots.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
What was his name?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Dea ex machina...
Why did you make me flood the school?
I want to show you something.
Why do they call you Frank?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Wanna walk me home?
Don't look so freaked.
So... you just moved here?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Where are you going?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Will you please talk to me?
What?
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Grandma Death.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
So, I met a new friend.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
Is Callie still around?
Regret.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
I... What can we do?
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
What?
He was a year ahead of us?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
What is this shit?
Is Mom okay?
What is wrong with you?
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Mrs. Leeman?
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
This, this... This is bullshit!
What're you doin' here?
What?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Okay... well, bye.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Are we on "Cops" again?
This here's Loretta.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Dakota.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
What!
This is -- what?
I will if you shut your piehole.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
My dear President...  read it back...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Yes -- why?
Have you got a license?
Half watch dog?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Are you getting tired?
Are you sure you're not tired?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Was it -- swine?
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Yes.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't we?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
...everyone has been very kind.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Oh, no.
Have you read it?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
How awful for John.
You alright?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Righteousness for his namesake.
...Yes potatoes... but...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
The children! May I see?
The Children. Where are your children
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
My home.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
The workhouse.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Yes sir.  What's that?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Right! Where is he?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Those things in your hands.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Erik. You don't understand.
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
No. 
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
He wants to kill US!
Is there something the matter with it?
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose... no...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Louder.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
I... I... KILLED her...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You must help us.
You mean we'd be dead?
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
There is another way.
Wait, Erik!
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Vanish into thin air?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
You know, my son, our lord said...
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Let me go, Sven.
Well! Come on!
Get away, Snorri.
My brother blacksmiths!
Help!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
So did my father and his father before him.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Thanks, guys.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
You rat.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
How are you today?
It's okay, really.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I don't really know how --
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Take care.
You like that?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Tomorrow?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
I don't think we're ready.
More?
Oh?
What if you hide me?
There's this guy!
I scoured the city for it.
I told her today I need to end it.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
You know what I did.
I think, before.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I wish we did. You married?
Bye, Joel.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Yeah?
You must have been crazy.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
So then she just stops calling.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Yours?
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Definitely!
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
It's stopped.
No way. I can handle this.
I swear.
And after that?
Oh.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Thanks.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Well, where was Patrick?
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
You don't?
A traveler, eh?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Extraordinary!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
What do you think?
Why? Why do you have to go?
For magazines?
Ballast.
I can see why they sent you along.
We have a man down...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
What?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
What is it?
Do you hear it? Right there.
What's happening...?
90 over 50 and falling... .
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
...I don't want to die...!
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Can anybody hear me...
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Any survivors?
No one?
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Weir is dead.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
But...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Miller, come in...
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Hey...
Where is she?
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
What happened to his eyes?
A straight line.
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
What are you doing?
How'd you know it was me?
Those yours too?
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Where is Reed?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Are you alright?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Reed?... Sue?
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
What are you doing --
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Front page?
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
You're happy for me and Victor.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What's going on?
Victor, your scar --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Is everything okay at work?
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
Oh. Hi.
What's going on?
Take that back.
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Who's that?
Seen the new Playboy?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
My brother is gonna shit.
Was it great?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What do you think?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It couldn't be.
Not coming? What happened?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Mr. Spicoli?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
What's that?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Aren't your parents asleep?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
What about the notes?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Let's have lunch!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Can we make it?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
What tape?
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
Read the newspapers.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Stop it.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Where's the tunnel?
You seem mighty collected about this.
Ohhh.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Why do you take shit from him?
We're going to get help.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Really?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
Will these boards hold?
Is it gassed up?
How many?
Welcome back.
NO, but I will lock you in.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
DON'T!
Hold it!
Go! Go!
Oh my God... What is that?
You know you don't have to do this.
I admire your strength.
We should stick together out there.
Are you lying to me?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Excuse me, sir?
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You're afraid!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Hello, Harold.
What's up?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Get your clothes on.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
...I see.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Were you an alcoholic?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Kurt!
But, Kurt, I...
Name?
Age?
Address?
Just one minute...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
You don't know what you want.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Oh no...
Serious, huh?
Don't start, Farmer.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Where are we, mean man?
You know something, Harry?
Frances, You're crazy.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
...Is that not true?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
What happened? Who're you?
I'm not!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
But they're using you!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
I think I need a little air.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Say you promise.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
...Did you really say that?
Is there something else?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
And he drove me to mine.
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
Nice.
Why?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Must've been a terrible row.
Nothing. Still nothing.
I should go. I should leave today.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
What does it say?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
You make me weak.
I give you my soul...
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Victor!
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
Quite a few.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They'll hang him all the same.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
How much longer?
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Electricity.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I heard.
Cabin B is ready.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I don't hear it anymore.
I'll be along.
Claudette...
Give me a hand?
What is it?
Chance to get even?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
What hath God wrought?
Ow!
How about our last jay?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
It's just a dream.
Best over...
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Is this real?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
I don't have the slightest idea.
What are you going to do?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Are you okay?
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
Not even for lunch?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
What the fuck was that about?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Do they have a waterbed?
How's it feel?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
They're gonna search the van.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Keep your voice down.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
My shit is together.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
Got it.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Oh, really.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Aw, what is this...
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
"The Lark Report."
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You'll think about my offer?
I'll try anyway, sir.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Chances of recovery?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
So dump on me.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
That bad?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
So why are you telling me this?
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'd sure like to know who.
Last time I didn't.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
O'Neil...
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
We're fucked.
Thought you two were file-closed.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
You okay?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Wish me luck!
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Hence the radiation.
They didn't make it.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Are you looking for this?
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Hello?
This is it?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
"The show must go on."
At ease men.
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Settle down, Alex...
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
A boy comes to the door.
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
You said "the Commander.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What do you mean?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Shit! Go!
Go. They're off again.
What?  Up?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
...The digital conveyor.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Thank God. Are you okay?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
never doubted you for a second.
That's it, It's go time.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Yes.
Wait. What did you say?
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Former Commander?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
WHAT? WH
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
The army needs you.
Well, George, who were you?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Any word from Canada?
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
No, please; an advance on your salary.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
What is it, Marquis?
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Martha... what?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
General Greene?
What the hell are we doing?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Well, this must be about something!
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
You're out of your mind!
You hear that?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
About sixty.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I need the money.
Where's Karen?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Ray Barboni?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
You live in Miami?
You're an investor, is that it?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Have we met? I don't recall.
I'm looking at you.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
Part of it, yeah.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
One of his best parts.
She looks familiar.
Just a thought.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
So you want to know.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
How about this?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Very nice...
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Why not?
You sure?
What took you so long?
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
Hm?
I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Harry -–
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
How about now?
What? You sure?
Damn mind of it's own.
Let's not be too hasty.
What day is it?
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What other choices have we got?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Bodies're too fresh.
That'd be my guess.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
You mean, before she sank.
That's a good thing?
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
What?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
It's not gonna hold us.
What do you think happened on this boat?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Epps? You there?
They went crazy.
Yeah.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Oh, man.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
I thought you say Tuesday.
What's this?
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
So Josh...
I just stopped in to say hi.
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, well --
Hi Enid.
What? Why?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Hi.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Hi, Al!
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
Look, maybe that's him!
What's he doing now?
This is way too creepy.
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Not really...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Where are we going?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
How about this one?
I totally, totally hate you.
Give me all your money, bitch!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
You're gross.  See that guy?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Just some people from work...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
What? When did you see Josh?!
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Hello?
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Hi.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Who does?
Oh, how "punk."
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Is this one any good?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
So is that your boyfriend?
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Jesus...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Never...
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
Uh... sure... come in.
What's the matter?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, well... me neither...
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What are you talking about?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
You were contracted to work-
No hints, Samuel.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
And it worked?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Very good indeed.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
Second death? Where?-
Got me out of trouble.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
I'll be bait alone?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
Nonsense.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Good news?
Do you love her?
Soon. 
Afraid of lions.
How many cattle?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Oh no.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Hello, Peter.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
I'll do it.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does she know anything about babies?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
What now, Brainiac?
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Who, Ray?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
I'm Ray --
This is what you do with your spare time?
What kind of tests?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
What's your story, Pete?
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you all right?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Is that your professional opinion?
You really don't act like a scientist.
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Great rehearsal.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Who's the stiff?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Yes?
Did you see anything?
Don't cross the beams.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
All right.  I'll try.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Those are priceless sculptures.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I want that bastard dead!
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Then you'd be out of a job.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Where is my family?
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
The Senate too?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Serious stuff...
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Who the hell are you?
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Take your hands off me animal!
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Do you want some dinner?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Will you take me home now?
Where is the car?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Did they ever find out?
All right.
But you're not enrolled.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I don't understand --
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would work.
Why do you have to see him?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben!
Ben.
Are you listening?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Can I help you, sir!
A single room or a double room?
Is anything wrong, sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is there an ashtray in here?
Will you take me home?
Thank you.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Drink?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
What do you think?
Aren't you?
Thank you.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
Did you get us a room?
Do you want to?
Why don't you get it.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
What?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
What kind of car was it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
Good.
Good.
Well, I'm not.
What?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
This is absurd.
Drive down the block.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Why did you say that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I do.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I'm just --
Well --
Why?
Say that again.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Hello.
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
What's happening?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
And what are you going to do?
How?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I'll pay you back.
Like dancing?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
That was lovely.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
You live here?
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Yes -- tired...
Go away. Who are you --?
I want to be alone.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
No?
And?
And what do you do -- now?
That's a silly joke.
So --
Do you understand?
You do believe that I really love you?
I'll go -- good-bye.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
I've no luck.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
For me?
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
No - absinthe.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Tired?
What is this?
What?
What brown hands you have.
Not too quickly.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Miss Flaemm.
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I know you did -- I said you did --
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Good morning, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
It is time for the performance.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
What is this insolence?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Just one moment, sir.
I know -- I know.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What's the matter with you?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Pretty as a picture.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Permanent damage.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
Not much time.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Yes, yes, but that's --
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
What's up?
What? Me?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I tripped over a chair.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
I didn't teach you that.
Let me see how you did that one.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Roy?
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Get well soon.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Yeah?
You -- I don't know.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
She didn't see you, in other words.
What is it? What's going on?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
You watch that mouth.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Ate the gun. Oh.
I can be real stiff.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
A dead body?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm not leaving without her.
What are you doing here?!
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Look, they're staring right at us.
You aced it, didn't you?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
You've been watching too much TV.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Mommy!!!
See what I'm talkin' about?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
God ... this can't be true.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
God, what's wrong with him?
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Where are you going?
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Hm?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't tell you everything.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Can I have the Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Huh.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Insurance!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
You invited me.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Ask it!
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Excellent!
It makes life spicy.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad--
I'm a man.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You don't even know me.
This is crazy.
Some kind of animal?
Like hugging a lamp post.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Your old beau?
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Harold!
Please--
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
Breakfast?
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
It couldn't!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Unless she has nerve.
He cried.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
No.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm going to call the police.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're old--so old.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
I'm an honorable clown?
You hope.
The new hero is you.
You're too modest.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
What is this thing that kills me?
No.
Thank you--for my life.
Alice is dead?
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
I'm only ten years old.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
A lot of people don't.
I hate that thing.
Where will you be?
Yes, he is.
Mom?
Really?
Everything stays as it is!
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
Coming.
Did you see him?
Is he all right?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
What's the matter now?
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
It's true.
You and Harold are friends?
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
You know each other?
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Do it!
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Or get eaten alive.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Yeah.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
Is this all the display space we can get?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
The other girl is the star?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You making a feature?
Joanne?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Up front?
I thought you were going to bed?
You don't drink?
No.
How important do you think sex is?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
She left you right?
Granville?
Did you find out where she was?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Hello?
In G.R.? Why?
I've got a meeting...
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
But this is my apartment.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
What happened, pilgrim?
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
I don't know.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Not exactly...
To his own daughter?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
We planted it.
No.
Officer, I can explain.
Because if you are...
And what do you do, my dear?
How interesting.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Sorry I'm late.
I don't know.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Yearse!
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I like Glaucus.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
With God?
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
That wasn't very scary.
How about some candy floss?
Do you think there is any life up there?
Yes.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Supper for two.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Mother.
Would you like a cigarette?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Yes. It does.
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Why?
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
That's right.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Parasite!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
You knew?
I want to go back!
I knew you'd come back.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
What?
What do you mean?
O.K. Let's go.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I'm scared.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
Don't get psychic with me.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Son. About Rasputin --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
It's her choice --  She's human --
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Who's the squirt?
I don't want him.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Sir, may I go first??
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
-- should go back. Now!
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
What was that??
Nah, sounds too "needy."
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Hi.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
What about you?
You fucking ass-holes.
Want to buy a bed?
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Oh.
This isn't for real.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No time for argument.
Just in time.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
You remember.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
What happened to you?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I'm hurting
Well?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
So where's the harm?
That's probably her now. Or the police.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
No, damn you --
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You're done worse.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Are you all right?
Larry...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
Is this your place ?
This isn't the bedroom.
Why don't you do the same?
I'll get the doctor.
You wouldn't believe me.
Where are you?
You'd like the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
Of course. Every day.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
I'm afraid it's true.
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
What do we do if there isn't?
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I beg your pardon?
Oh!
What did I say?
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Yeah.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Fuck off, Barry.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
A couple blocks!  About six!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is that it?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Well we rang $900 today.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Yeah.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
It sounds stupid.
Never?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I told you I slept with him.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I'm a good person.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
Do you want me to be there?
Look, are you coming or not?
You're soaking.
What do you want to do?
When are you going back?
What it was like.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
But what?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Hi.
Just local, of course.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
Don't you like that?
The Conformist.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
So you'll stay?
Which way are you going?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
She left.  She's gone.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
I think you have more.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Doesn't have a head, does he?
No.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
Who?
Why not?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
You want me to front for you.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I'm not even sure why.
He is older than I.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Not the same.
I haven't killed _you_.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
I'm calling an attorney.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Stop.
He told me there could be only one.
I'm twenty-two.
It is as you are.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
It will take less effort as you learn.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Something pretty.
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
What is your position?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Don't threaten me, Private.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Where!
The last four.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
_Answer_ me.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Tradition.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Did you know the victim?
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Morning Mr. North
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
He's in the insurance business.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Exclusive? That's great.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Double-crossing swine!
Where is she? Tell me!
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Ring that number, will you?
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, darling!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Who locked the door?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Where is he?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Just one second --
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
What is it?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
That's a lie!!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it. 
Come on with that money!
You know it is!
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Hiding him where?
Mother!
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Don't forget about production for use.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
What's he want?
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Do you know any swear words?
Sod.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
But Dad, It's the News.
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
What is it?
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
No Turks.
Has Sue got it right?
And what's that?
Well?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
What would we do if a German came into the house?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
What is it, pet?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
It seems to have survived.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
That's not something to joke about.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
The Duke?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
But suppose for a second you did.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Just grin and bear it.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Go around him.
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Check this out.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Is that all... think real hard.
How's about you give me those same directions.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
How long is that gonna take?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
So.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I still don't.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
Oh, right.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Well hello, officer.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Hey.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Tell him, Harold.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Say my name.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Shall we close up, then?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Fine.
Like what?
I've moved on.
You were wonderful!
I want our boy back.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
My apologies, madam.
Very well.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Progress!
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
No. I married a midget.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
You really enjoy my company?
What are you doing in there?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Who is it?
Who from work?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Do you like my new look?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
I think he's ready.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Interesting.
Unn.
Mother?
Pittsburgh?
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
You bastard.
Are you ready for another?
We'll be there.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Only when I work.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Seventy-five per cent.
For me.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Hello, Eddie.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Sign up.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
So does Eddie.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I wanna walk.
I got time, Bert.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Who's he?
Yeah, that's right.
Whaddya mean?
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
That's right. When?
What time?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah. You must come again.
How much are you ahead?
How long you been waiting?
Yours.
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
Why did you do that?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
I'm hungry.
What did all this stuff cost you?
Do you want me to go?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
No, I want to walk.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
I came to play pool, Fats.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Do you remember where it is?
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
That's who you are too, Emma.
Do you still want me to stay?
So, what do you do?
Bathroom?
Is the hill ours too?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
It was so real, Dad.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
Is that all he said?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
No.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
No one comes here after dark.
Don't go in.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
What do you want?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Not really...
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
What the hell is that?
Spunky?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
This I can see.
What're you doing?
Any news on my wife?
And our forces?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
Dick-weed.
So, what do you do for a living?
Stop it.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
How' he doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Yes.
May we go home now, please?
What has the old fool got himself into now?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
That doesn't look much like a library.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry, the pen --
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
DONOVAN!
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I'm through!
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
My room!
Uh-huh.
What are you going to do?
No, Dad. You listen to me --
If only I could have been with you.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
How did you she was a Nazi?
The floor's on fire! See?!
Dad!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Where's my father?
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
All right! Where's my father
Who are you?
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
What's that?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
You all right?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
What about the future?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Not leftovers?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
What?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
What is it...?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What?
Anymore ideas...?
The last Sankara Stone.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
My name is AL.
Somebody's been here.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
What for?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Anyone there?
What's that?
What do I do?
Did you hear that?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
I did. I brought you back here.
Thanks.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
Door's locked.
A lab and equipment.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
What do we do?
I don't have any.
It's just not enough.
Now what?
Eating sushi?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
It's sand.
She's...pretty fast.
Which language?
What?
Touch her.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Now, where would I be?
Much too blue.
Not that tie with that coat.
Which one is she?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
I feel like an idiot.
You got any books in there?
What Happened?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What next!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He was with Gruner!
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Dieter!
Be quiet.
Gimme a minute.
She works for them.
You're a lucky man.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You've cut your hair?
How about a deal?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Sir?
Bit expensive, sir.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
What brings you here?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
When you remember...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you want to get out?
Take the card.
Not...complaining, actually.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
Yes...What is it?
What?
Then who did?
Blake said that?
Let you leave without it.
Can I help?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
And how'm I doing?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you stay with me?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
I know the territory.
So do I.
What?
Riuji?
He wants to apologise.
What could you find in this place?
It's alright.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
Ow?...
It will.
Yeah? What for?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Where?
Push it.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
What the hell are you doing?
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
What caliber is my gun?
That computer has everything...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
How prominent? What kind of placement?
What do you need at the store?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Yeah.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What's wrong?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Is it too late?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
No shit.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah.
I disappeared on you?
Did I get you up?
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
Mike... in my...
I know what I have to know.
Did work.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
I told the truth!
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Most certainly.
Hello.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
What a touching story.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
What the hell is Botox?
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
You're in check.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Is she Asian?
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Getting married.
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
She never particularly cared for me.
Friends?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
But?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Comfy!
I want to nail you ass.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Hello?
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Miles Massey.
Every week --
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
You're not...
What?
So what?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Did Marylin end up with money?
And it's good!
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Hi, Sweetie.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Well!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Why should she? After all—
Why; naturally, I—
What would you like to have me do?
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
No.
Whadda you want!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
I don't want it reported!
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
High time you got back.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Must be the Spring.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Detectives!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I better go over and see her.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Not a one.
But what!
What are you thinking about?
Really?
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
You might give me a little credit.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Whatever you say, darling.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady—
Yes—if he is your husband.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
You're drunk.
Who's she gonna marry?
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
A trumpet?
Send it collect.
What's the idea?
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
I can use a smart guy like you.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
You love them, don't you?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Did he pay you for this?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
What's it look like, Nick?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Why?  What's wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
I'm scared.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
Aren't you being a little hard?
Who?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Goddamn Sam!
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Who do you think changed the parade route?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Well, thanks for coming.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
And he never hit you before?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
How many men are working with you on this?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Do you walk home?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Does he have the marked bills on him?
How'd you know where he was?
What's she want?
We are. Don't worry about it.
Can I have a word with you?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Help us do what?
How was your flight?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
That doesn't sound dark.
What have they told you?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What, I couldn't hear you?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How'd you feel about it?
Fifteen thousand.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Why?
You talk them into it?
Will Ordell go for that?
You're avoiding the question.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
You're rationalizing.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
We'll just be a minute.
How can you help us?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Not yet.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
What did you do after that?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
I have no idea.
I'm waiting for the phone.
What were you two fighting about?
It looks good on you.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
What do you think it is?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
How the fuck they know that?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Who's paging you?
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Four years?
What for?
Which one?
Did you ever go I one?
I lived there for about nine months.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Thanks, Baby.
Uh-huh.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
So what, you left her there.
You couldn't just hit her?
So you're sure she's dead.
Louis?
Came outta where?
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Who's it for? A relative?
Getting there.
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
You still there?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
How the fuck did he find me?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
It's the next street.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Well, how do I look?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Well, try, huh.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Not me, buddy.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
A bit.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
She hates me, Louis.
I had this weird flash just then.
Ah!
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
No.  I see them.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
That help?
What do you think?
What happened to you?
Thanks.  What's that?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Yeah, but for what?
I must have been out of my head.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Ready?
I'm going home.
We're at Della's.
I can't do it.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I know.
How come? The army?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Who was that?
I can waitress. I'm good.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where have they gone?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
You can have anything you want.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
WHO ARE YOU?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
You come here often?
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
How was Palm Springs?
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
He'll never make it.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
Still married, Jake?
I just need to talk.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
The army?
A car accident.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Okay, enough of this shit.
Duck fuckers?
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
Bomb?
Okay that hurt.
Nice touch.
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
How many?
Then what do we do?!
You're a teacher.
Sergeant!
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
What if you miss?
Hey.
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
Spunky . . .
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I'll help you in.
Close the fucking door!
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
Barbie from hell...
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
That's it! Radio in for help!
What about us?
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's comin' up -- !
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Don't forget these.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Now tell me something I don't know.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Who's that young man?
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
What? What?!
What happened?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
What day is this?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Look at him take it!
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
You love sharks?
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Charisma?
Okay, cool.
Really? What are they like?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Why?
What, you mean as friends?
I try really hard, actually...
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
We don't even have a dog!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Viscera?
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
I rock a Harmony.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Junk?
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
But I thought you'd be cool if...
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Oh my God...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
No...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Please stop now.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
A hotel?
Hi, I'm Adele.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
I'm cool.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Tight fit.
This the book your writing?
Henry Lucas.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
So tell me... what happened here?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
What's that?
There's more...
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Carrie... stop it.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Bri'.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
Could be.
You're clean.
Shit.
What do you think?
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
78th.
Why?
You got any money?
Can you do it man?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I don't understand why you do that.
Right.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
You goin'?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
Yeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?
Sup then? Sup?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Come dance.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
You are being ripped open.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yep.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yep.
Oh shit.
Yep.
No. I was just kidding.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Right.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
The door was open.
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
Yes you are.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Ready for round two?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
To get your attention.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Yes?
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Now what?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Why did he?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
It isn't Kathy.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
Same as the others?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm busy right now.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
Answer the question.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
You're always in the middle of a match.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Bainbridge Books.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Is this your first time here?
Are you one of the players?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I know it was bad.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Lyssa ...
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Can she be forced?
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
They can be saddled.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Go, join them.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Quell?
My heart stays here.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I'm hungry.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
And do you think I live on air?
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
He will not!
What news from our friends?
Freylag's stronghold?
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
The new King.
You know the voice.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
She has the power of vision.
Look.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
But you would not stay with me.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No, no.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Rocket launcher.
Who'll I aim at?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Mathilda? May I come in?
May I go to the cinema?
...I'm going to kiss you.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
How shall we get out now, Leon?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
You say it just to calm me!
Don't fear.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
You can't sit here like that.
...OK... Good.
...Who sent you?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
It's impossible.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I have to finish first.
How long does this... Mania last?
It's a special day isn't it?
Ellen?
What it is -- is the truth.
There's no reason.
Walk with me?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
I want children.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
That's okay -- really it is.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Well, hello.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Where?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
In a hospital.
Good morning.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Sarah -- with an H?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
If I was I'm sorry.
Don't run away.
Thank you. What time is it?
What do you mean?
Sera...
Don't you like me, Ben?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
What do you mean?
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Your color.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
You know I love you... yeah?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Were you with another man?
I'll take that as a no.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
How many, would you say?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Why didn't you call me?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Yes?
-- his life?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Good one.
You can't go home!
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You almost had me fooled.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Don't ask.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Projecting joy is not my job.
Oh, my God!
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Almost.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What're you doing here?!
I did?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Good. Good.
I didn't mean --
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
More fun win battle?
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Yes?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Might we watch, too?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Fine-looking army.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Beware.
This is ogre's magic.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
I should hope not!
God's blessing.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
What magic have we on our side?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Aye... my Lord...
A promise is a sacred oath.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
How much longer?
Jack!
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
They tricked you.
He did run?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
Tis the truth.
My lady mocks me.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Sigurd's sword...
No!
I don't believe you.
This is sad news, be it true.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And charmed, of course.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What's she doing?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Hello, Jack.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
He hasn't called?
Why?  What do you mean?
Atonement.
Are you his friend?
Alyssa.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
I can't even take a shower here.
Huh?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I was wondering.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You hate your father.
This is such a street of whiners.
Are you guys' friends?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Oh.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
Well, it's the least I can do.
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
You're here early today.
George, this is the third time.
Are you totally insane?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
It bugs me.
No one would blame me if I left!
When are you going to be back?
Did you got through my pants?
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
I know the feeling.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
Sun glasses?
I would have killed him.
I loved him too much.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I still don't know what that means.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
You should lock your doors.
What?
I need to talk to you.
It makes me sad.
It's not breakfast yet.
Finished or unfinished?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Do you need help?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Peter left me yesterday.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I'm helping George build his house.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Despite you.
That's the problem.
Do it now!
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
What are you doing in my room?
Adam, that's not true!
No, nigger.
She's doing just fine.
These are free papers.
Why not?
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Like this?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
So?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
What's up, Ray?
You still got that map?
No.
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I know people.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
I know you're not talking to me...
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
You got your own nightclub?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
You mean Louis Armstrong?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Mama?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
Lemonade?
Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
What's your name?
Is this a joke?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Hello, Cassius.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
She goes to Parson's, right?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Try an angel.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Did you just talk?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
What's with that guy?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Come on. One more time.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Hello.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Valerie?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Yes...
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Do me.
No.
Why is that funny?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
I'm a Sandman!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Where do you think we came from?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
What other food?
Do you have anything special in mind?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
Who invited you?
What the hell took you so long?
What's going on, Logan?!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
You prefer women?
You felt sad. What's your name?
I'm not armed.  Well?
What Quad do you live in?
Why show me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
What's that?
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
What belongs to the people?
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
How long have you been living here?
Are there any other humans?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Are you ready to put him in?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Well? How do you like it?
Good... You up for a drive?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Why not?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Okay...
Sure.
Have you partied with him?
You like it?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Better.
Yeah.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Have you made any charges against him?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Yeah, Mack?
I want to see him.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Do you remember?
What is this, Rogoff?
That's it.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
At your house.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
Good book, huh?
Same one you were reading the other night?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
I told you to stay in the car!
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Hello.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
You still care about me?
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Not even a radio?
Two years!?
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I see.
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
The police?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
What are we going to do?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Huh?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
If you want me to!
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
And mine's Conway.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Well, is it?
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please let me help you.
Oh, immediately.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Are you taking me?
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What's it mean?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Uh-huh.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
was saying—
What do you suggest?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm so glad.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
The hell happened?
The hell were you thinking?
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Helluva night, isn't it?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Ha ha.  No, really.
What's going on, Kay?
The radio show?
How does that help me?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Since how long?
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What do we do?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
What are you doing?
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Goodwill...
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Did he say where?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Kay?  What's your 20?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
And they're buying it?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Actually, I don't know...
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
No.  Follow him.
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
The other two will die without me.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Why?
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Tell me not to worry, John.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
Red Ball?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
You're certain?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
If it's a question of authority.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
Wally, listen to me...
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
I scored a goal!
What the hell.
I forgive you...
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
What about the picture --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
What's so funny?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
You said they're destroyed.
Oh, God, what did you do?
This is all my fault.
Who?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
The guy from USA Today is here.
How did you get this?
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
Raincheck?
This your work?
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
They've never been separated before.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Not on me, sir.
What, sir?
All the suites are about the same.
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
He's great, right. Is he great?
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Hello.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
You talk to Max today?
I feel weird asking him.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I want you to quit.
But what about them?
I said no touching.
Get your hands off of her.
How bad is it?
Heard of them.
That it?
This is it.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
You want --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
What's the plan?
Spa?
Taken care of?
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Any time, bro.
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
So, it was a draw.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Fuck them.
I think we might.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
What? Did she say something?
Right here's fine.
Oh really. Why's that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Nothing else.
So they said more than the address.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Motherfucker...
What the hell did you do?
We're not getting whacked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Let's check out the penguins.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
Calm down.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Dude, we were practically made...
Kinda. Yeah.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Stop.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Coke?
No, really, mate?
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Is it nice?
Sure. You boys want anything?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Yes. You're going to New York.
Yeah.
What about my keys?
We're square.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
Who's gonna outfit us?
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
Keeps me out of the army.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Man live by his rep.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Don't con me. Don't try...
Don't con me.
I can't make out that shit.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
What can I do for you?
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Is the program ready?
What?
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm in Detroit.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Did you hear what I said?
It will be rough.
I'll be away a lot.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I just want to sit here and be still.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Just what are you saying?
Can I ask you something?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Yes sir.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Senor?]
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[Daniel.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[What money?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Drive.]
[Please, don't...]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Were you provided with a gun?
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Yeah, right...
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
No.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Hmmm?
So you were unhappy?
Do you think he'll come back?
Well, I let him go.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Did you used to?
The blocks.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Then be trained.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
It makes it all seem so serious.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Bye, Mom.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
You helped him get this job.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
I'll call her up.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Waddaya gonna do now?
You want me to ride down with you?
All right, I'll see you!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Who?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
You say something?
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Hello, Ma.
It's loaded with what?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Okay.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy...
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What do you want me to do?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Yes, O'Reilly?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Which hospital?
Miss you, Walt.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Y'all just act natural.
Never mind. Forget it.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Look at the size of those two beasts.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
You betcher ass, Dad.
I think I heard about that.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
The bastards outconned us.
How did you get called that?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're asking for somebody else?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
What's wrong with him?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
About that chest-cutter...
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
What's wrong with you?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
Never mind.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Did you get it, too?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes!
Who?
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
The Websters!
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
I can read. I can read!
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Okay, fellows.
Has he been here?
Where's Connell?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh—
What do they want?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Ba-ll!
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
How could he be a fake? 
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Join the John Doe Club.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
I want it as soon as possible.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
How about family? Got any family?
What's your name?
That's a lie!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Is there a crowd in the street?
Hello, guys.
They're not usually graduate students.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
No shit! He's good!
Where's the stereo?
What's the line?
Who is it?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Don't make do it, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Where's the car?
Really?
What?!
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
It's all there.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Recruited you from where?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You don't like New York?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
I can't do that.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
They need to run first and second?
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Please. I'm begging you.
Maybe you should be.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
It's already started.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
You like this place?
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
You crazy? With all those people around?
The hell I am!
Stay up there, Girl...
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Roper...
What do we got?
Any verification on numbers.
There are two million people in there with you.
They have nothing to do with this --
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Do you believe in miracles?
It's time to wake up.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Dream?!
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
But what if he doesn't --
How long?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Try harder.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
One condition.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
What did he tell you?
Need the disk back!
Insurance?
You went to my high-school?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
You said we were on the same programming team.
Why?
But you were with me.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
So how can we get to it?
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Anybody see anything?
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
There goes the neighborhood.
It's... an eagle?
And how do we release the power?
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
That was a CHEAP shot!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
We're asking you to go to prison.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Luciano.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
You got something to hide?
You could have stopped him.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
We'll figure out something.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Where we headed?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
You get fifteen percent.
Forget it. That's past.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Special occasion?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Death! Thank you!
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Bitchin' good cake.
What are you watching?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Stu?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
What's the matter?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
It was?
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
Did you like the first act?
Oh--yeah--
Diz--
How about getting married?
Okay. You don't mind?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
You know, we're getting married.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
One minute! Just one minute!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
What!
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Well--goodnight.
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Hello, Jefferson.
Can't you?
What is it?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
You mean--here?
Have you always had to--work?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Abigail.
What do they--? Who are all those--?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
That's--that's splendid.
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
You want to see me, Senator?
Nice *compliment*!
What do you want, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Why don't you do it yourself?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
That's him. Let him in.
Will the Senator yield?
Order!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
He's still pixilated.
Any children?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Were you present when all these things took place?
But they did take place?
And you saw them happen?
You are , aren't you?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Mary, I'm going home.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
How'd you get the picture?
Sure.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Who? Miss Dawson?
How's it going? Okay?
Gold, eh?
Fourteen carat?
I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!
Miss Bennett please!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Must we have the echo?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
I've got one for Cobb—
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
That's funny. Why is that?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
I'm Chairman?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
We provide opera.
Now, where were we?
Your Honor—
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Uh-huh.
That ought to be fun.
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
You came home last night - without them.
Please!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
What's that?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
What brought this on?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Althea hasn't told you?
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
What?
It was Henry Follett.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
...so rich?
Doc...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
I think you know what I mean.
Well, look who's here...
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
I'm not making any promises.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
And this is legitimate therapy?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Transference!
Hello?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
How's it coming?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Damn! What is your name?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
But look at me now...
How'd you do it?  The new you.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Sorry...
I guess that makes sense.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
That was a terrible thing.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
And what ritual would that be?
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Now go find me a big stick.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
Two hundred pounds.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
That "thing" gets me excited.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Do you really think he'll show up?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Much less go outside.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Come here.
Then why are you here?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Hi.
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
You're the Sphinx.
Oh don't start that again --
There's just not enough of us.
I'll drive.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Roy --
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
The Obliterators!
Really?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
She likes you.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
That was too close.
Oh no.
It's time.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Ah -- you approve?
What do you mean?
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Who is there?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Why are you carrying the dog?
When did it start?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
No -- not as a rule.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
Only Lisette?
No... nothing at all.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Yes -- what is it?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You wrote it.
How do you know?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
And where do you place Alexander?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where you going?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
How can they do this?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
I will.  When can I come visit?
You want us to give you a ride?
Hello, remember me?
You did all this for me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I don't play for no team.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You coming in?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You see that?
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What it say?
Are they still out there?
Roach, what are you doing?
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
He's inside the house?
You wanna knock?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Ah damn.  Damn.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Where's Craig?
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
William.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Ezal!  Ezal!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
You just come in on Amtrack?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You shot her?
Who did?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
Are you 'fucking with me!?
Is that something precious?
I don't know.
Ready?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Irene is going to help.
Well?
What are you going to do!?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
That's pretty good.
Where are we going?
That one.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
No, Ben.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
You understand?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
And the Lord told that man --
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Is he hit pretty bad?
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
What could have possessed that girl!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
John...
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
What are you doing, boy?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right boy: where's the money?
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
John's bad.
Can I have my supper please?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Didn't you have no inkling?
How's that?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Them kids is yours?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How can you tell?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Much better.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
How you plan to do that?
Hello Nancy.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Get into bed.
You okay?
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
You okay?
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
What's with the bars?
Guess I should'n'a done it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Someone else was there.
And then what happened?
What you mean 'all at once'?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
You feel better now, right?
Thank you, Comrade.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You feel it, though.
What is it, Anna?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
That must be the one!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Which lawyer?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can call our ambassador.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
Leon, my little boy.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
Let's do that.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
We don't want to be disturbed.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Comrade Buljanoff...
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Allow me, Comrade.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Business.
Confess what?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
Yes!
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
How long do we have to wait here?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Can I help you?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Why do you need my finger?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
And what is your profession?
And what do you do for mankind?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Oh, let it ring.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
I have never heard one.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Not funny, huh?
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Go on.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Radio! What is radio?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Hello, Leon!
Did you win?
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Make it ice cold.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
That bad?  Old or young?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Now, please, Swana.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
That's all right... I grow on people.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
The future of the common people.
At Père Mathieu's.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
How much do you need?
We could get that.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
It's a code or something.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
I like it.  I like the idea.
This is not a joke, John!
Why not?
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
This is June twentieth?
May I say something, Mr. President?
I don't have a pistol.
About a dozen.
Sir, the deadline is today.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Just do what I say, Bob.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
What'd you say?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Kissinger?
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Who we working for?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
So, what's this about, Dick?
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
No, Henry.  I don't.
... as the old alliances crumble.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
He was a politician.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
How about Kissinger along with him?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
But it was all we had.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Bernstein.
We lost ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
I'll do it.  No more.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Were you planning to tell me?
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
He looked old, didn't he?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Congratulations, Dick.
Yes.
And what am I doing?
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
What?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I am older.
Yes.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Hard to believe.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You gonna drive out there?
...This month's checks.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
I got it Mama.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn!
What're you doin', baby?
Odessa.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know where the money is.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Where does he work?
Hello?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Mm-hm.
Airport.
I don't know.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
With anything?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Well... I need to close now --
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
That's me.
Then you'll like me.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Were you in Nam?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Don't jack with me.
Are you in the service?
Could I have that in American?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
Any idea where it is?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
No... what about your sister?
It's all right.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
I beg your pardon?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
I don't think your friend likes me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
What's the matter here?
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Worse.
What are you doing?
It's something I had to do. For David.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Guess who I saw today.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
You should have a little faith in people.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Your husband?!
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
The fuck you talking about?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Could you give us an example?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
That's right.
That is so right.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
I hope you're right...
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
This is Betty at twelve.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
What did you say?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
You can't do this -
It ain't the law!
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
Huh?!
How'd he know about the treasure?
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
She's at the five and dime.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Okay, okay. You win.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You... in the Navy?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Joe!
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I want to fly, sir!
No, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
You're good.
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Where are you from, boy?
Louder!
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
You're sure it's okay?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Could you believe those girls!
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
What if she called the cops?
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Who is this guy?
Open it.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Oh, I've seen these...
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Watch your mouth.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
Something's weird.
Ever read any Poe?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Fuck.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Morse code?
Got him!
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Those ain't cops.
Alma I told you to...
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
What's up?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Inspector Brimmer
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
I don't think that will be any problem...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
C'mon let's...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
We appreciate your help with this.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
My Mom's at that.
This cool the heat off you any?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Ain't no one seen him.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
What do you mean, old and ugly?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Excuse me?
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
We did.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
You learned her lessons better than I.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
A long time ago...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
And your principles?
We saw.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Francis.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
That bad?
Put those away.
Father?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
It's gorgeous!
Honey, Church will be fine.
Yes.
Is he really all right?
Ellie? What's wrong?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Ellie--
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Was it Pascow?
Not yet...how much further is it?
I can hardly read these.
It's Church.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
She's finally asleep.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Thank you, Louis.
Getting there.
I heard you tonight.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Now?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
I'll drop it!
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
I knew it.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Say again?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You cheated.
Move away.
Move!
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Agreed.
Come aboard.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Just do it quickly.
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
No, it's not.
You haven't seen it.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
How long do you leave him in there?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Pollution?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky!  What's happening?
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Yeah?  So what?
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
You were never invited to my house.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
Susie!  You gotta help me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
We don't have time for hysterics.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
Susan!
Look at this!
Just look at it!
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Just like old times.
Do you have something to bring me down?
No cheese.
What's that?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Argon's private lab.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
What in the...?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
You're not going after Argon!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Icky!
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Indeed? How interesting.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Do you like them?
I know that.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm not going!
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
What is this person doing here?
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Ah-ah-ah!
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yeah!
Oh, is that so?
Impossible. Put it on again.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
It has been alleged - yes—
Well, when are you quitting?
What play?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Araby?
No?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
There you go, talking like a woman!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
To Old Madrid.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
What did he want?
What other girl—?
A statement? Good.
Traps shut!
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
We just thought that—
Yes.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
What is it, Smythe?
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
That's puttering, sir.
Mary Sue?
What?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Does it look okay?
And they won't be able to tell?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, hi ...
What?
You can't go out there.
Like a drum.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
What?
But where would we go?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
I'm busy.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Are you alright?  What is it?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Hello Bud.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
You have no right to do this.
Not directly anyhow ...
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
No. She really liked you.
Keeps going ...
Real rain?
Where are they?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
... Her father.
Yeah ...
McIntire's.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Where are you going ...
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
I had nothing to do with that.
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Do you have the lettuce?
You know what I really like?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Really?
Oh, hi.
What's wrong?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
I know.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
It's not cool?
Why's it here?
Goodbye.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
No.
It doesn't matter.
...yeah....well you have me now.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Me?
So you think you can?
They're not open yet?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
What happened?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Hi.
That was good.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Have a good trip.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Do you wanna have sex?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Where do you have to go?
It's a plastic, yeah.
On my knife.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
Who is this?
Can we agree that that is that?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How you doin' Barry?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Why you wearin' a suit?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What's up?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
Hey.
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Seven o'clock.
I know.
I know.
I'll see you there.
Your expenses are your own.
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
That's it.
So they'll go.
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Just tell him to call me.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Marquis? Is that you?
Madeleine --
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Free his mouth.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
What on earth would that require?
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
It's no secret that you loved her.
I saw the longing in your eye --
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Well?
It was not inspired by circumstance.
I'll do everything in my power --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
But I am history.
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
It's a long story, this one.
What have they done to you now?
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
"...your wife."
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
Leave at once --
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That poor woman.
Sure you can, just--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Who are you, sir?
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
Oh, why is that?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Marion--
Then you explain it to me?!
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I just want to understand--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
I wanna see the picture today
Hearst?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
What are movies about?
Magic
But with compassion and insight--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Why her?
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
What?
I'm sorry.
Hey, kid. Gregg.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
Shit
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
It came.
To do what?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
This is an abomination There's no music and--
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
For Christ's sake, shut up--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What's up, Colonel?
This looks done.
Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
Where you going at this hour?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Who's that?
Yeah --
How do you know? You know her that good?
With her? How?
Do you see her yet?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You want us to wait for you?
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
What do you mean, "you"?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
Three more, I figure.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
But, Jake, I was just...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
Where you been all day?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I dunno.
The kids are sleeping.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
I said, let's go.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Like disposing of their wives?
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Jewelry?
But I'm not a killer!
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Jefferies.
This is Wednesday.
Wrong day?
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Where?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Hello.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's only perfect.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Huh?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
And you love life?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
What doesn't?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
From his landlord -- once a month.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Huh?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Steady Marlon!
Feel okay?
Meaning me?
Where can we meet?
Tell him why we moved here.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Blood.
We don't have time.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I was talking to Jim.
Frank!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
I'm here.
Hey where'd you go?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Isn't it crazy?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Why?
Here.
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Why?
I shot at one of them.
What?
'Bye, Mom.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
What a zoo!
If he could--
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
No--I was just--maybe--
Ever been in a place like this before?
How many rooms do you think there are?
What?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I never felt so clean before.
After he tried to shoot you?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Plato, where's your father now?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
She's being called for.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Good evening.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
A man of some travels.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants... your "sister"...
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Saw me --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Where the hell are you going?
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You forget where I work?
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
You motherfucker.
That guy knows you?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
You... you... YOU --
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
Put him in the truck.
So you could get with my sister.
What'd they call her in college?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
The hell you don't.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I can't go back to Vegas...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
What about the money?
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Don't move, Rudy!
Jesus, Rudy --
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Me and Mr. White?
What?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Mr. Brown?
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
What's that?
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
You gonna put it away?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Your name's Freddy something.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
For what, the cops?
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Nope.
I got the diamonds.
No shit?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Anybody hurt?
And this is Helen Carter.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
What's the matter with her?
So am I.
But you eat, don't you?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Coffee?
But the rest is right.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
All my clothes --
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
I found their surrey --
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
How does she draw?
At the ranch maybe?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You'll live.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I can't take her with me.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
But I want to stay.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
Even women?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
We might as well start a fire.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
How do you know who we are?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
How about California?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Goodnight.
Are you okay?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Where's Shorty?
Ray, run faster.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Better try a little higher.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Let her go, Cin.
How about these buns?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
This can't be happening?
Noooo!!!
What the hell are you doing?
Father!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
You could use the grade, huh?
Oh.
Are you?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Professor, we need to talk.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
What are you working on?
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You never could feel your legs.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
"Ray!"
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Hi, Mom.
What a bitch!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
You bring me such peace...
Don't wake the kids...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Hello.
What did you just say?
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
Certainly not!
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
What was that?
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
We can't stand here all night.
When I wanted to.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
Why, Mary --
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
What were you talking about?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
I'm going to find your sister.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Well?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Let her know what?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
My window - - through which I see the world.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
And you believe that?
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
And the other was Judd?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I was a great dancer...
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
That was quick.
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
You play an instrument?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
You're what?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
About sex?
What about sex?
You just ask them questions?
To you?
Why didn't you tell me?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
That's a good question.
Tell me your name.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
So you do fantasize?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
That's correct.
Yes.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Graham...
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
When did you begin having this feeling?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
What do you mean, like physically?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Do you want to leave therapy?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And what?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Thank you.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Do you like the way I look?
Prettier than Ann?
I would.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Who said I was jealous?
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
John?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Student?
Everybody has a past.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
What tapes?
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
He said immediately.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Medical clinic?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Yes? Who is there?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
You bet, Bert.
How's Brad?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
Infantile regression.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
Could I do that later?
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
I'm...happy.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Miles.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
Hi.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Oh, that's tasty.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
What?
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
That's your problem, Miles.
How would you rate this one?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
We should have driven.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
What do you think?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Later.
You should call her.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Fucker hit into us.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
With Maya.
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
We gotta go back.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Please, Miles, please.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Want me to drive?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
What are you drinking?
Oh yeah? How is it?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
What's the title?
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
I had class.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Sir, what are you doing?
Should we get dessert?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Where's Jack?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
See you, Miles. You take care.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
It makes me feel better.
A hair.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I don't want you to die.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
I see.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
I cursed.
Should we turn off the lights?
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
I can feel air.
No.
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
We might lose the signal.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Did someone save me?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Okay.  So he was tall?
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
Is he okay?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
McKendrick's men got him.
Paden sends his best.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
You're not Baxter?
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
Women?
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
You might make a farmer yet.
You own this land.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
The jury saw it differently.
What makes you think I could?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
I've given that up.
You've got a legitimate job.
You got a place to stay?
I thought we talked about that.
You work here?
And I know what I'm talking about.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
You're not renewing my contract.
Why not?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
There isn't one.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
She doesn't want pity.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
... Simone.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I just read somewhere --
Thank Simone for the tickets.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
You look so, so...
Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
How will you do our love scenes?
Absolutely not!
You can't.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
-- We call them "vactors".
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
There was no other way.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
She thinks you're with Simone.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Mr. Sayer...
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Let's take it down a notch.
A star is...
You mean they buy it?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
The only real truth is in the work.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
What'd you write?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
That isn't magic.
Yes.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Cats?
Can I ask you then?
--What?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
You see ghosts, Cole?
What are you thinking, Momma?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
How did you--?
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Could take a little while, though.
See?
Bitch.
Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Dammit, Carl!!!!
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Gene.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Well, there goes our record deal.
You're out of your mind, man.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Name something.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Suzie --
You're... limping.
Listen to me --
Like your guitar break.
Second verse!
Carl.
Shit.
How are you going to find him?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Hey there, Chief.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Where are you going?
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
I loved you. I loved --
When one sees you they all see you.
Praise Jesus.
What's he get if he wins here?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Why're you driving so fast?
So tell me about yourself.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
Guess what?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Hey...
Kate...
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
My very words.
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
See ya, Bandit.
What's your pleasure?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Cledus.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
How long's this gonna take?
Also boring.
Bandit?
Loud and clear.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
Never mind. It's nothing.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Talk to me.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Breaker. Breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Have any trouble getting here?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Bandit two, you read me?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Oh.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
Anything on the Swede?
Are you on a land line?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Buzzy... Buzz...?
You got clicks, anything?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
... Jesus... what for?
Wow.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
I'm working on it.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
Why?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You'll end up like me.
I want to hear your version.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Why would you let her to do that?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
How long can you go without sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Kelvin, you awake?
Perhaps it did.
I need to see Snow.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Not a very happy poem.
You're better when you take them.
Is it a planet?
What happened?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
What does Snow think you should do?
But we fought.
Was she right?
You don't want me.
You said he was dead.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I think they help.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
How can you be here...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
You want it coming back with us?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You could do better.
Claire?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
I do care about you!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
What do you want to do?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
They guys treatin' you all right?
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
I'll miss you, Mike.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
So how'd it go?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Okay?
What shit, honey?
Honey.  You got him.
I'd identify him.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Why?
Coming to bed?
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
What did you watch?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Not Koontz.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Are you in charge here?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Watch your step!
And Flash isn't?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Are you okay?
Yeah--
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Good morning, Liz.
Of course.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
No…
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
You make my mouth water.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
You are being rude again.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
You were saying --?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
What do those broads say?
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
I'll open mine now.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
What are you going to do?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Says me.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You heard that, Sefton?
Go on.
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Yeah?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
December seventh, forty-one.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
We have no radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Data?
Data, are you all right?
Is she still angry?
What?
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
Left behind?
Where is he now?
I don't understand.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Antonia?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Yes.  Thank you.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Aye.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Is there a problem?
Report.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could it be Spock's?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
Same sector. Metallic mass.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
My readings indicate great instability.
Later. Let's go...
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Captain, what's happening?!
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott...
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
The word, sir?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
David?... David!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
... He spoke of your friendship.
He asked you not to grieve...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Sir, may I suggest --
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Sir, may I --
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
It never rains but when it pours --
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Khan could be down there!
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Until now.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Does that about do it?
Don't tell me you've got something.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Scotty -- what's left?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
<u>WHY</u>?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
And who is this?
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
What IS working around here?
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Very well.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
That was a little joke.
Khan!
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Time from my mark...
I really must thank you.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
He's very human.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Humans make illogical decisions...
Heard there was some excitement.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
Bones --
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Hi... Busy?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
You're saying... It is a compliment.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
My name?
I do not know your name.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Yes, sir.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Do you trust me?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
I'm all ears.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
The late 20th Century.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
I meant --
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Aye, sir. Descending.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
I'll have to re-energize.
Full power, sir.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Hello? Computer...?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Don't panic...
There are days.
Will it?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years...you never learned to swim?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Why not...?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Hello, Data...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
How many?
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
You're not going to launch anything until...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
You're not finished here?
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Will that stop the tear?
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Deck five.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
... Population three hundred million...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Wine, women and song.
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
Come in.  Hi.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
Isn't it better like this...?
Can you configure it?
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Did you know her?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Where?
I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
This must be it.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Their com system must still be down.
Main bus...
Where are you from most recently?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
What do you want?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
What?
What makes you say that?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Why?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Life signs?
Port battery, ready sir!
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Worf? Is something wrong?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I believe the operation is over.
What the Hell's going on?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
I was nervous -
They'll respect him now...
He's a DOCTOR!
Spoken by you?
You were demoted...
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Torpedo room--?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They're preparing to fire.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Aye, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Stand down your weapons.
Kronos, sir?
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Where?
We HAVEN'T fired -
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I SHOULD have been -
Close enough to beam down?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Direct hit -
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Why?
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
Remember him?
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
What do you imagine this is?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Yes.
Why?
What purpose does this serve?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
What is our approximate distance?
No.
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
No.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
Sir, we're being hailed.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
What's this?
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
But she's not the Enterprise.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Yes.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Report!
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
This is a mistake.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
No -- this is wasting time.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How many Warbirds will you need?
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
You have one with two beds?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Recognize this?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Clarify that.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
No deal.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Money.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
I am husband?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Why are you going here? What is here?
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
No... The closest...
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
The captain...
You can have one.
Where are you going?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
The cook again?
The yellow one.
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
What do I do now?
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!
I don't know where he is.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Can you see under the faceplate?
You married, Major?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Yeah, that's right.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
You have to go.  I mean it.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Clips.
What?  Right Here?
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
Naw.  She won't call me.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
So there never was a death squad.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Forget her.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What is it?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
He knows what he's doing.  He's worn before... a lot.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
No it doesn't.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
There's a plus side?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Mace... you're a girl.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Besides that.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Anybody talk to the press?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
What does the Manager say?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
A grill pattern.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Excuse me?
What are you...?
Look, mister...
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Speck. Harold Speck.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I'm hesitant to...
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Don't you touch him.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
None taken.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
You work with Koessler?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
It's quite advanced.
Jaime --
What happened?
Unlock these cuffs.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
How's the arm?
What was your weakness, sir?
So you went underground?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
I'm sorry?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Well, thank you...?
You too?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Charles! What's up, man?
...not until you book it...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Oh my God.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
What do you guys do?
Do you have anything smaller?
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Lorraine?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Yeah.
So what's the difference?
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
You want to hit the town tonight?
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
There are so many beautiful women here.
What's dumb about it?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
You little bitch!
It's kinda money, actually.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
What's he do?
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
That's right.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
VEGAS.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Wake up, baby.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
It doesn't matter...
You're gonna screw up our plan.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Always.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
I don't think so.
She likes you.
I don't know...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
I gotta use the phone.
She was hot.
I don't think so.
That was different.
Don't remind me.
...a day...
He drives a carriage.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
No. Doesn't that suck?
We got the digits, baby.
Bitch... You little bitch!
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
Now?
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
You're money.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Shut up, Sue...
...Okay, two...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Godfather!
You take care of Paulie?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
Is it necessary?
This morning.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
You mean Tattaglia.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
And this?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Barzini will move against you first.
You tell us about America.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Beautiful all over, eh?
Give them some money and send them home.
Is the hospital covered?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Was there a definite proposal?
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
I'm German-Irish.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're talking to themselves.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, what are you doing?
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Tell me!
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You straightened my brother out?
Yeah.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
We?
What? What?
Hi Tom.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Marge, you like everybody.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
You like jazz!
I have to go to Venice.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I didn't mean with you in it.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
Ha.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Frederico!
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
You should watch that!
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Dickie!
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
Look at me what?
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
It's all true.
I told you! I knew it!
Where's Dickie's father?
Which is?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Dickie, my God!
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
No.
What did he say?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Not guilty.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Even her.
I don't remember the exact date.
No!
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
Thank you.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
How much to get a permit to carry?
You want to canvass?
Why?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
The DMZ?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
Hello, Travis.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Travis?
Just what?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Oh, are you all right?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
That's fine.
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
I have.
Can I see you again?
Well, you want to or not?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Why not?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
What do you mean?
Have you tried the telephone?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I'm no cop.
Wha -- ?
Real down.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Not really.
No.
Spit it out.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
You knew?  All this time?
What about you, Delly?
You've got everything?
How'd it go?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Whoa.
What did... what did I want to be?
Do you have the...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
My what?
Now, did you remember that, or...
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Are you saying that he's...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Why?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
That's where you live.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
You should watch what you say.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Cigarette?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Sit.  Play with me.
I suppose.  Thanks.
You hungry, son?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
I was wondering...
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
And the second?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Is anyone there?
Yes, I did.
Mother!
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Lois!
Where does he live?
See where I'm pointing?
I see. How do I get down there?
Of course.
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Mitch...
We'll worry about that when we get there.
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
No.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He was killed last night. By birds.
He's not home.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
I don't know you.
What are you? A policeman?
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
What did it say?
Yes, but...
Certainly, but...
Will I be seeing you again?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
I'd still like to see you.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
I do different things on different days.
You look a little shaken.
Last night? What do you mean?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Birds?
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
You must leave this house.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
But Richardson?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Well --
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
See that, Fettes?
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Are you a doctor, too?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
I would make you rich.
But why, Gray? Why?
You and I should work together.
But where did they get those people?
Any attacks of pain since?
How long ago?
But can anything be done for her?
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You're not going to Gray.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Two down. Two to go.
That was a fucking hollow point!
You killed her. I saw it.
You lied at my trial.
Fucking Zombie.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
Are you ok?
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's ok, it's ok...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Erin!
What were you yelling about?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Tell me what?
He gave these to you?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
The present situation?
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
How do you know?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Everyone seems so-- 
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Why not?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
All day.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Death to all vampires!
That's right.
Where you going?
With him?
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Sure.
We are...
We're getting close...
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Lights out, Sam.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
But you passed the test!
Are you following me?
I'm Michael.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
What happened, Michael!?
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Who are you calling?
What do you want from us?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
What you doin'?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.  Now...
You catch anything he was saying?
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
MacReady!
Torch them!!
What are you doing?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Anything?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
How long's it been?
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
What is it?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Yes.  Just about here.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
This has to end.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
It's spectacular...
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Alex... people are staring.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I know that --
You wouldn't believe me.
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
How long ago?
Is he all right?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
Alexander...?
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Where do they take them?!
You won't even try?
How did you get hurt?
We'll see about that.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Sir?
But... what about Starks?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
This is really happening, isn't it?
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Jackie, go play in the snow.
[Beat] What's your name?
You're just gonna walk?
What're those?
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I have no idea.
How long do we have?
I might not be able to.
Where are we going?
What?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
What about the world?
Why not?
You told me this was how it happened.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
I tried to kill my wife.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
It's gonna be sticky.
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
You want a drink?
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
Hon.
Honey?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
We're both fine.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Oh shit.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Hey, peaches.
Hello...
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Exactly.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
But you think he fools around.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
What's wrong with you?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Holy shit.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Like a Chihuahua?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
This is so beautiful.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
You do?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Thelma, that is not an option.
He said they're charging us with murder.
We can live in a hacienda.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
We've gone insane.
Shit!
What?!  What d'you think?!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Where you goin'?
Yeah... sure did.
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Why not?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
So... I see you made the news.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Here's the info you asked for.
Stalker, huh?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Here, just have one of these then.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
Oh yeah.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
How'd you know that?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
How about -- ?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Fuck!!
Turn it up, Magda.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Are you okay?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
She's blackmailing you, right?
You want her dead, don't you?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
You bet.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Oh. Well I am.
I see where you're going.
Meaning?
So who's the lucky guy?
I don't watch the new ones.
Bundt cake?
Holy shit...
What's up, Doc?
What's up?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
So who you taking to the prom?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
And did everything -- ?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
Why not?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
That you put a murderer on my trail?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Hey.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Uh-huh.
Piggyback ride.
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Starshells.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
My father --
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Yeah?
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
How's my favorite President?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Secretary of Defense...
I was eating that.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Let's get out of here.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Hey.
Yeah.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I see.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Who are you?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
I did.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Who is he?
Tread matches. It's the car.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
What?!
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Why does he wanna see me?
What did he say?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
This Clear Moon's house?
He's gone.
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
What?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
What ya want?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
How so?
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Yes, ma'am.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Two.
Yes. I'll give you that!
What if he's not?
It dies. We live.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Well no...inverse order.
You ever fly an F-14? 
That's what you get flight pay for.
You don't have to do this.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
How do you play reality.
Now?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Well?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Sir?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Let's hope you're right!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
No! Not again!
Is there something I should know?
You're not supposed to...
Let me do the talking.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
That's not what I heard.
So I've heard.
What was that?
What are you doing?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, we're next.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
You saved our lives. You did it!
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
Yes sir..
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Why?
Or you can quit.
Welcome to Mars.
So, where to?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Two-headed monsters?
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
What is it?
Not since you lost him.
Pull them out.
Sit down.
What, aliens?
They sell fake memories.
Yeah.
Hey, Quaid!
What trip?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where?
Are you saying she liked it?
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Is that better?
Who?
Let me go!
Lori...
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
I give up.
What can I do?
Like what?
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
I might have an idea...
Oh my God.
You didn't cook breakfast?
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
You're full of shit.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Prairie dog burrow...
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Son of a bitch!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Down, honey, down.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
It worked!  There they go!
...Where're we goin'?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
How can you remember that?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
We have a full caseload, Rog.
-- an angel dust dealer --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I haven't paid you.
You do.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
Afraid of what?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Edward T. Dowd.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
I don't think I know that name.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
And why was an exception made?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
Tell me some other things about her.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No... No, go away.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Sort of shorthand.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Noooo...
Oh god, Laura.
Call me.
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
You want a muffin?
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
You're not mad at me?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
James...
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
We were supposed to be together.
What do you mean?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
You'd think so.
Can I take the car?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Are you sure you're okay?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
I do. Yes.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Say it.
We went to Code Blue...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
What is this going to cost?
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
I am on the staff of...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
I'm sorry...?
Kathy Price...
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
A single hour.
Yessir. I'm sorry.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Is it over?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Dr. Gruber.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
I have to talk to you.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
...I have to stand up for her...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
Right.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Yes.
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
There's nobody left around here now.
You look kinda lost yourself.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
How does it happen cars are running?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I never noticed before - that's a cowboy tie....
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
How'd you guess?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They don't do much of anything...!
They are living creatures out there.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Just be careful, okay?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Like what?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
DO you mind...
What?
This is going to give you nightmares.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
What...what is that?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Fred Krueger did it.
I want to see the body.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That was Nancy, not me!
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Looks like weather.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
I can't go in there.
Can't do it.
Stow away?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Who is it Philip?
What?!  What's happening?!!
What?  Come on...
It matters to me.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
It's outta here!
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I can't be sure.
For killing a dolphin.
Yes.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
What's Cao Ben?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
This your car?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
That is my permiso.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
The Good Witch...
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
In a fire, as I recall.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
You okay, honey?
What's that honey?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
...are followin' him around.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
Sailor!
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
That don't smell like a More.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
What was this one?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
More'n likely.
What's that, peanut?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
It's a comfortin' idea.
Oh God, Sailor.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
It's okay by me, peanut.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Course I am, mama.
Six.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Just tell me what you want.
You need to explain it.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Put your shoulders back.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Actually... I just want to go home.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Mm.
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Yes.
Shit.
Tripp?!
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
Crabtree.
Shut up, James.
Naturally you have copies.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
No. But I don't think that matters.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Well...
You cold, James?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Is that really it?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Thank you.
Want me to get that?
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Isn't this...?
Humboldt County?
Colon cancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
I just wanted a little sip.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
So, why did you take me up there?
It's warm.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Where you going?
I'm not going with them.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
That strikes me as odd.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Professor Tripp.
And? Are you going to tell him?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Pow.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
And the jacket?
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
I know.
You don't deserve me, you know.
The more the merrier.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Walter?
Who's this ?
Oh?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
There's so many...
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
You doing okay?
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
What are you doing?
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
What do you mean?
I don't like starlings.
Try.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
Were you watching me?
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
What does that mean?
Hiya, Walter.
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You don't know?
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
Are you taking your medication?
I'd keep away from him.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Just trying to be helpful.
Have you seen Walter?
No.
Robin?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
You should go home.
And how's your job?
Try it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you know what "normal" is?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
How do they know?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I want to be normal!
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
Go home, Walter.
Close your eyes.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where?
Where are you?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
You felt pleasure.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
It's going to take time, Walter.
There's something wrong with this picture.
Very weird.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You plan to drink both those beers?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
How about in the morning.
Why do you want to know?
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
You mean the time you're locked away?
And what do you tell yourself now?
You know, this is crazy.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
You're scared.
Neither am I.
It's a bad idea.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
Fine.  Be that way.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Jesus, Lindsey--
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
No.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Son of a bitch!
Virgil?
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Y'all could be more specific.
SHIT!
Cab One, radiation readings?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Uh, oh...
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
How are you?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
A little more so this time.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Don't be so humble.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
What is it, Claudia?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Claudia, let's get married?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I'm too sleepy.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
I'll stay here also.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
And what are we going to do now?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia...
Why don't you try?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Yes, sir. Three times.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Zuria?
Yes.
I can't say.
No.
Because...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
For what?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well, who in particular?
Who?
Do you think he loves you?
He's told you?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Down... there.
Would you like to be?
Would you like some?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
How did she know that?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What the child?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Sometimes, yes.
She's dead isn't she?
She tells you you're ugly?
Are you pretty?
You're a mistake.
And why am I here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why were you afraid?
Why?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Would you like to tell me?
And then what happened?
What is it?
Yes.
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Do you remember what just happened?
Are you frightened?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
It was dead.
You saw it all didn't you?
H... how?
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Larry...
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks. 
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
Marie's dead Mama.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Yes.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
What man had access to her?
What's his name?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
She has it now.
It's my affair too.
I'm only interested...
How?
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
Listening to angels?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Fine thanks...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Pipe!
She's been touched by God, yes.
The father!
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
You went to the room to help with the birth.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
I'm a deserter.
Why aren't you at work?
Can you fix him for me?
Sure.
You don't think...
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
Are you pulling my leg?
Oh aye, a sledge.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Where are you off to?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Yeah ... so what?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Give 'em a pull.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
What's old got to do with it?
Y'what?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
You've got a midnight matinee.
My eyes are lighter.
You're a window rattler, son.
Well!
What do you think are you're up to?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
What?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
I feel like shit...
I got it.  Oh boy.
Any rotation?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Close enough to walk to!
I'll go first.
What is it?
Breathe deeply.
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
Well, get started.
What do you mean?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Where's it coming from?
What happened to the lights?
Dead!
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
And when will you be ready to do that?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
Where did it come from?
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
He's running a fever.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
What?  What was that?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Look at that.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
This is horrible.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Blow the ship up?
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
What's the frequency?
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
What'd he say?
<u>What is it</u>?
That sounds a little fanciful...
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
We do know that.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Yeah, okay. 
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Now what?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Let's hear it.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
Headache?  Dehydration?
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
What is it?
Better?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Not yet.
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
Listen to what?
De Vries?
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What the hell are you doing?
Careful of that edging there...
Still got him?
Wait.  Lost it.
Is it still moving?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
And...?
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
What is that?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
How do you know my name?
You're more than modest.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
I don't think that's funny.
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
What do you mean by that?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Because I don't want to.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
Margo? Lunching in public?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Bill!
You've already met.
Right here. A minute ago.
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Bill...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Then you're crazy.
Happy birthday, darling...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The audition.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
I don't have to. I want to.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Yes. Yes, it does.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
What have I got to do with it?
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
Who are you?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
How long does it take?
That's the door.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
She's got to meet you-
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
If I only knew how...
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Not just that way. As a friend...
You won't forget it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
But the raves about your performance-
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
She knows enough not to be here.
How'd hear about it?
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
If you'd like.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
How far to the station?
He's in love with you.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
That's on time for Margo.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
What time is it?
Lloyd, be careful...
You'll break your neck on that ice.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
- well? What happened?
Would you, really? How sweet-
When you do, let me in on it.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I'm sure.
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
I don't think I could be.
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
And?--And?--
We understand your problem--
Republican?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
What's the matter?
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
Hey... very tense.
I think.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
But they both worked at the White House?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--I'm not your source on that--
We can't talk inside either?
They are not my clients.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
How grand?
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
Where in government?
Where?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
...go on, go on...
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Charles Colson?
--who you got?--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Howard--
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
I'll do it.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Me too.  For the most part.
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Come on!  I won't tell.
What?!
Why are you doing this?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
You want onions?
You're missing the game for us?!
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
...I've never tried it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Okay.
Yes dad.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Dad.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
You can do that?
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
No...you...go...ahead.
Shame on you!
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Serafine...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Are you crazy!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
What does it say?
Oh God. Shit...
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
I don't believe we've been introduced.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Hurry, Grandmama!
Who did you hear it from?
Noooo....
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Dmitri?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
What?
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
I did no such thing!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
It's an important issue.
You're like New York. You're an island.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Two minutes, Alvy.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Stop it, Alvy!
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Right!  Where?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
I'll see yuh.
Fifteen years?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Really, do you think so, really?
Hey, listen, listen.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Hey?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Look, look at that guy.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
No, I'm not.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, I know it's small.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
What are you doing?
Oh, you have my body.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Yeah.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Very big spider.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
What?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Oh!
Alvy.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I can think of another word.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I mean that as a compliment.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Probably on their first date, right?
Yes.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Charlie Chaplin.
Mean?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Oh.
Well, sit down.
You like this house, Max?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
They're persecuted enough!
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Well, hi!
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Yeah.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
What's that?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
It's going.  It's going.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
What is that thing?
Thanks for coming.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Take good care of it.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
But she's alright.
Stupid tart.
There's a test, you know.
Oh yeah?
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
We closed.
Scout's honor.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Accept a compliment.
Kiss the back of my knees.
What?
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Yes.
Fuck you.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
No.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Panes!  How are you?
What's a sign for that?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
And I you.
The infamous dog?
You lose this?
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Easy tiger.
Scout's honor.
I need to leave you now.
What am I, five?
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Of course it's alright.
What?
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
Well, yes, actually.
What?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I...
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Is there space here?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Like Joe.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Well good.  Thank God.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Really?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
We're going to die!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Of course --
Of course not --
You new, kid?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Barbatus!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Not that one.  Or that one.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Affirmative.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
This the place?
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I hope everything goes all right.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
And where are you now?
When are you coming home?
Something wrong with your legs?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I am. Let me get the cards.
What for?
You are?
Why not?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
What are you doing with that?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I mean, after that?
We're going to finish that gin game.
How's everything at the apartment?
I guess so.
Are you all right?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Sir?
Who?
How do you work it with the key?
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Sir?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Yes, sir.
No key!
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
You can't come in.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
What's her name?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
How's the patient?
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
What about him?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Good night?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Kubelik.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Yes, I know.
That's right.
I don't believe you.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Moonby what?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Sometimes.
What are you doing out here?
What do you see?
What are we doing here?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Smoke !
Get in there !
What the hell is it?
Listen.
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
What cat  ?
Our Recon flight ?
Touchy.
Spooky.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
American weapons?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
What's your name, sailor ?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Don't you agree?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You've gone crazy.
How's yours?
I think think a lie stinks.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
Captain Willard?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
20   CONTINUED:  
30   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
117  CONTINUED:  
39   CONTINUED:
Oh.
Have you talked to Eric?
Stay here.
Did you catch Corbett?
Was there any trouble?
Where's Corbett?
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
It was blown up with the plane.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
I already have.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
If Corbett's men find out --
What's wrong?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
I'm too old for this shit.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Go easy.
You hear me?  Ben?
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done blood tests on him?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Why did yo do this for me?
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So you'll be at work?
No... no thank you notes.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Thanks, Melvin.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Sex with Simon?
Hello.
Okay to say something now?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Well...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
How to die, mostly.
But what about...
What the heck do you mean?
Help!
You changed the room around...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
No. Please, don't force him.
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Sure thing.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
No, I didn't.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
How do you write women so well?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Five million dollars?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Who?
Is this how it went, Nick?
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Twenty large?  That's all?
He wants to kill you?
Forget it!
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
How?
Had?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Hey, where are you?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
In Costa Blanca.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
That's right.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I told you, he will.
Yes.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
What are you doing?
Because, I'll take it.
Can I ask you something?
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Would you like a drink?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
For what?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Right.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course, senor.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
How to make a buck!
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Who's your friend?
Oh yeah, what's that?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Yep, except a name for this place.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Like helping a sick kid?
Perfect!
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
My God! What happened?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
God, I think I need a holiday.
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
It's just talk, he's drunk.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
Will this thing take long?
A champion of lost causes huh?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Did you take your things over to my place?
Run into Josh?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
Hey Doug, where you been?
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
What if they expel you?
Out with Belinda?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
I'm thinking.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
I don't make small talk --
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
I'll get something for us to drink --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
He doesn't trust you.
It's a start.
Before we do this.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
You're acting like a crazy person.
I don't understand...
Come on.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What'd you tell your father?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
So what do you want to see?
Are you trying to seduce me?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
What are you thinking?
I'll talk to your father.
I'm asking how much.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
You're in the play?
I care for her.
This week.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
This is 1952....?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Dad, you seen the drill?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
What do I say?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
You mean, you're gonna --
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Operator...
March 11th.
Pro, the sun's out!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Pardon me?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's all taken care of.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
What do you feed him?
You ever held another job before?
You lost that one?
You like people?
Then why'd you do it?
Can I be honest?
Yeah.
Quit my job.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Why not?
You know what I think?
Don't call me stupid.
Are you sure?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Is he upset?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
That's Montana over there.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Have you got a better idea?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
Not me. No way.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
You're a welcome sight...
Anybody we know?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Dead.  Damnit!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I see.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
What's that?
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
What do you do far a living?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...That's fine.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Hold on –
What do you think happened?
Jesus, Charlie, I...
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
...Those your only bags?
L.A.P.D.
Is this multiple choice?
What did... What did he –
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
He teach you to do it?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Where were you tonight?
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
How are you, Nick?
So -- how are things?
How about the coke?
Yes.
You okay?
I had him in two classes.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
How long were you dating him?
Were you with him last night?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Because you didn't love him --
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
My wife used to call me that.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
Do you think I told her to kill You?
It's OK.  It's OK.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Why not?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
You workin' on another book?
What kind of drugs?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
He had a girlfriend?
Thanks.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
What you doin', son?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
What's goin' down, son?
I don't think it's funny.
I'm not afraid of her.
Catherine says you don't like her.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
If she's telling  you the truth.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
Where the hell you goin'?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Are you kidding me?
Fuck you, Phil.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
How old was she when this happened?
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
When's your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Ten bucks apiece.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Who is it?
When?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
What are they?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Yeah.
It's Andy again.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who's that?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
I don't really have any problems.
She's good.
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Do you know what he's saying?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
That is amazing. What year is it?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
Is that the best quality you have?
Some of them.
You're a fast mover.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Hey, Rene.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
'Phillips head,' right?
I need this?
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
We've met.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
And the truth frightened her?
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Y'mean frame him?
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And a very, very good one.
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
You certainly will not.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
It's good to see you.
Women.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
I was just hanging around.
Watch the first step.
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
What happened to his wife?
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
All the answers are numbers.
What do maniacs always want?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
We all wear masks.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Rinka.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
That kid is amazing.
He sure did.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Okay. I'm outta here.
You can't-.
Edward...
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
...or death.
How'd you find us?
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
No.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I don't sing very well.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Keep her on the line!
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
I understand.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
... Why the mask?
No.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Yeeees?
Do we know anything about him?
Go ahead.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Sort of half.....
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
0 my god.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Say that again, son.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
You're not going to ....
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Welsh again.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh... bye-bye.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Talk ta me, Bork.
Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Cool. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
Who sent ya?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh no.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Nobody else can.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
So can I?
Help vouchers?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Just get some people out of our house.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
What about Betelgeuse?
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
W... What is it?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Where is your mother?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
They're... not here anymore.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... Oh? You've heard?
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... He walked off...
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Did you lose something?
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey!
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
What is that?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
... Are you sure you like it?
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
I feel very good in here.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Well, that's good news, my boy.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
What about money?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Please, sir.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Good morning, Louise.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Have you served in the Army?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Correct.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No headaches?
Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
... How are the kids getting along?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
It's that gardener!
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This is not what I requested.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Thank you.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
I have to go back.
I have to go back now.
Why aren't you at work?
Why?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You've always hated the animals.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Don't forget me.
Tell her you need to see her.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
It's Elijah.
The monkey.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
So how was it?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester. . .
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
You can be John Malkovich.
The Great Mantini?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Thank you, Floris.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Ah.
We have to meet.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Come on in.
I'm getting better all the time.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Stay in him forever?
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
Well?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
She gone like they say?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
No. I mean work work.
MAMA!
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Hey!!
Hiya Allan.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
This is our concern, Dude.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Sir, please lower your voice--
What's this?
They range up to three thousand.
What the fuck is he talking about?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What tied the room together, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What's a pederast, Walter?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Those are good burgers, Walter.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
No, they--
Heh-heh--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Howdy do, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Oh yeah?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Excuse me?
I was talking about my rug.
You mean coitus?
Yeah, but what about--
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
What's your point, Walter?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Donny!  Please!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
Have it your way.  The point is--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
"Our" car, Walter?
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
It is a fucking emergency.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Yeah, and you were--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
What's mine is mine.
Walter Sobchak.
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude here.
Yeah.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Employed?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Who the hell is he?
What?
What about Nomak?
Recognize him?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Anyone else make it?
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
You want me to hunt them for you.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
You shouldn't be here.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But, he could've --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
What is this place?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You're hurt --
But you -- died --
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
But you use blood banks --
You're a monster.
What -- ?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
Domini?
Inside the grave?
Why?
'Thought those all got stolen.
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
--the witch kills children--
--<u>myth</u>--
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
Just...try and go back to sleep.
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
Okay, a blur.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
I don't believe this.
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
We should be so lucky.
Mi casa y su casa!
Fire escape??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Nobody's going anywhere--
Who?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--Cotter--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Okay, but--
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
What--
Just hold on!
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Jesus.
What?
What?
I should check on Anna.
What the fuck's going on here?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Your mother's pastor.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Where... where you going?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
...Ray?
...Who?
...Where is everything?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Well now you do.
What "what"?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
Red Label.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Thanks Meurice.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Not yet.
Who's this fuck?
Frank gone?
Bull.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like talk like that?
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Oh shit.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Falling.
Yes.
Yes. Frank-
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I asked first.
Dorothy. no!
I guess I should go.
What?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Heineken.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I've gotta go in.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Okay. thanks.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
... Sandy?.
Look Jeffrey.
Are you feeling okay?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Que va hacer?
This is it for me.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
You can't sell this to your friends.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
The coca is my responsibility!
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Goodness.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
What kind of project?
Twenty-six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Good to see you, Diego.
What's the matter, George?
Touche.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Figured it out.
I don't know.  My name is George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
But I have a visitor.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
For instance, something like this?
Right on.
Yeah?
So?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
But I haven't shot him.
Can you read?
Read it.
Where's Kader?
No ...
No, and neither were my men.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Take some time off.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What did they argue about?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
No questions.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I've got work to do.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!
Can I go?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Why did you come by?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
What about Miss Lawson?
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
Is it Marsh?
She was here?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How long were you together?
And how are you now?
Why did she say she was leaving?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
-- And what did you suggest?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What did he say?
What happened?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
How do you know that?
I suppose.
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
Three fifteen.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Yes.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
How?
I'm the photographer.
Nothing.
Hello?
Yes -- she did.
Really?
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Alone?
Sugar or honey?
I'm dropping the case.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Really.
I know.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, I can help.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
How bizarre!
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Don't say that!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
What are you doing?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Not yet. You want to go?
Carolyn!
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Madge?
Pretty country.
Are you from Washington originally?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
This time of year.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Oh, that's nice.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Where are you staying while you're here?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Smells like dirt.
When?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Are you all right?
No, I'm just saying --
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Oh.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I can't do this, honey.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
I... What do you want?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Stop it!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
You feeling better Franny?
What time is it?
I'm positive.
Franny?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
It clearly states in the will --
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
Those 'fools' are my people.
I said, no thanks.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
You know I can't.
Please.  It's for your own good.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
We'll have to sneak in.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Are they on the radio?
Why?
What else does she say?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Lucky thing.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Nice rack.  How old is --
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Admit what?
Open the case!
The money!
Gimme the gun.
Oh, shit ...
Not bad.  What for?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
He didn't see you, did he?
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
What are you doing?
Shut up, Violet.
I saved you.
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
Not on duty, sorry.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
You got the key?
So this is temporary for you?
Curious, maybe.
I had to see you.
Because it's the truth.
I don't.
What you heard wasn't sex.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
What?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Why?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
It's me.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, thank God.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
Forget it.
I won't ask again.
What do you mean?
What do they want me to do?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
His brother.  You know his brother?
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
That's what I'm saying.
-- you could put it together --
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- let me do this, okay? --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I trusted you.
-- we'll tell them what happened --
What is that?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Stop where you are.

And that's it?
Can I help you?
He run away often?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Sir...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
What the fuck is he doing?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
...your ducts?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thanks very much Sam.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Help me!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Take her off the list.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Are you alright?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Why not?
It does doesn't it?
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
No, really.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Turn!
I was right! Step on it!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Would you really, Sam?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
A cheque.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
Can I forget it?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Sod it, it's broken!
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
What have you done with his body?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Er, don't you want to search me?
Are we?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
I mean it fixed itself.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Es impossible.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
You're not going to die.
Sure, sure, give go.
Is there any chance?
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
Did you see my father?
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
He got better.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Last show of the night.
Whatja doing?
You okay?
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Do it!
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Hold it down, okay?
Hi.
Eventually rising to...
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
How'd it go?
Do you feel good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Yes.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Jane?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
What did he say?
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
Yes.  How do you know?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Anchor?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Go ahead.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
If we could just eat first.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
So he was indicted?
You okay?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
This is very awkward.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
That's enough.  That's enough.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Tonight.
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
What's up, Walter?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Nice night out...
Of course I do!
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
That's word for word.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Walter...I can't believe it.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Maybe so...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Go home.
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Hiya Carla.
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
I also saw the girl give you this.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
I saw your...cat.
Maxwell.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
You don't have to do anything!
Oh, OK.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
I look horrible.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Don't grab me, okay?
No, we didn't.
You're the guys from the movie!
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
I'm fine.
I'm hungry.
He doesn't look fifty.
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
Come again?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm going out the front.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
What are we doing?
Beverly Center.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
All right.  What do we do now?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Why do you keep saying that?
Here?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
I don't get it.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Hi, guys.
Buffy?
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
You're kidding.
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
The homelesses?
Buffy, the ape-woman.
What are you talking about?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
I'm yours.
No.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
I'd like you to meet my father.
I'm Crash Davis.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Crash...I want you.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Why not?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
He's a good student.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
You missed the tag!
He did know.
What do I got?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm going to the Show.
Why am I a fuck?
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Crash Davis?
Step outside, pal.
Don't try me.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Who ain't?
Ain't here.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
A powerful man.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Hey!
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
In other words, I'm fucked.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
No, no it's okay.
...very difficult to get in.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
...don't do it to me...
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Yeah.
...hundred yards further down the road.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
She was afraid to call you.
Hello.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Seven o'clock?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
I'll be right back.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
...pit bosses, floor managers.
You all right?
Why're you crying?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
You can't make me stop caring...
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
Right.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
The arrangement is over!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
With Jennifer.
She had the same.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
Oh...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I am not!
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Should I let her in like - ?
...and hypocrisy.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Well...
Yeah, okay.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
When I left here with the money...
...I got muscled on the street.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah.
I don't want to go to Europe.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
You gotta go back out there.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
You just - Just stop him.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Come on. I'm sorry.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's not here?
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Of course, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
You got a round figure on it?
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Tell me.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
Yeah.
You know?
I do. I need a new sponsor.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
...same outfit.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
All right.
Yeah.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Do you know that?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Yes, don't worry.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Yeah.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
They're havin' a good time too.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I know. I know.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Whoa. Calm down.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Charlie M?
Tony.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You're a little confused?
My fuckin' head.
That's enough.
Hi.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Have we reached the epi-center?
You know, nobody likes you...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
What's the matter...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
We're waiting.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You think so?...Selina?
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Good morning.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
Nothing. How's your hand?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
"Theo?"
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Tell me what she looks like.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
It won't be him.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
What did you do?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes sir.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
At least one.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
What's that supposed to me?
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
He wants 75 back.
What's Nels' number?
They did some great job of reforming you.
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Naturally.
Both hands on your lap.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
Pass.
Sure.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Yeah?
Where's the backpack?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
I already called for an ambulance.
The 405 is coming up.
It takes all types.
He gave me a look.
Saw that one.
He agreed that he was.
Maybe he wants something.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Who?
You American?
No.
You on the game?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
As different as it's possible to be.
Do you miss him?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
How?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You want another haircut, baby?
Why?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Don't call me that --
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Come on...
You heard what I said, Dil?
What?
You killed my Jody?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
Love me.
Say it again.
She was --
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Did you give him it?
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
She's nobody. She likes me.
You were made for this.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Jude?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why would you do that?
You sure?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
I thought it was Dave.
Thank God for that.
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
I'm not a gambling man.
No, what's the funny thing?
She'd be anyone's type.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Can't. Once I signed up.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Why?
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
When I was a child...
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Faster than cricket?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
And you know what?
It was fun while it lasted.
That fucker's dead --
What are you talking about?
You don't look so bad in this light.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Carson?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Café.
Steal it how?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Bartholomew?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Not my room!
Your --
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm not fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
What are you doing?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
What do you mean, no?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
No -- in my room.
How's that?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Please, not on my account.
Is your husband with you?
Shakespeare never said that.
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
We'll find you a hotel.
Who said?
I wasn't --
We're here.
Who is it?
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Why?
You do?
I think it's funny.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get all your CDs.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
It's almost ten o'clock.
You're grounded Friday night!
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
Ok.
Who is she Daddy?
What happened?
Hello?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
Why?
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Pay no attention to me.
_ Your father raped someone?
Mark Shale.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Oh nice save.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
This place is empty.
Cut it out.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
You know I want to go with you.
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
You ok?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Maybe it won't stay in.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
At least somebody likes this shit.

 Oh...
Shit!
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
A little early for a delivery.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
What did I say?
I need your truck.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
...doing?!
That dog ain't mean.
Come on, get in the truck.
...-ed.
We're clear.
No, no, no.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck!
...the ice cream for money!
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
 

Shut up.
Take your gun!
I was thankin' you, asshole!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...Shift.

Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Shut up!
Ho, ho...
...ho!
 Aw, shit  
...here!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Oh, no!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Okay.

See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...truck.
 Yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.

 

Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Listen, Arlo.

Yeah.
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Mason.
Oh.

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hang on, hang on.
What'd you come back for?!

 Well.
You.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
...and the government.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
"Went away."  I like that.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.


Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
...comes up that road.
Hit him again.

There.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
Yeah?
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.

...and unharmed, de-...


Geneva just pulled the plug.
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
 ...that tunnel.
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
My secret?
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
Call an ambulance.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
What?  Say again, Ma-...
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...public drunkenness....
I said let me see your hands now!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
What the hell was that?
  All right.

Negative.  Negative.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
Sir?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Too bad?
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
At my age, you tend to lose track...
What about her?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
I'll just tell my wife.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Then what'll you do?
I'm not.
Hello, Jake.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You've done well by yourself.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
Or her name?
I don't want it anymore.
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Is there anything else you want to know?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
You sure shout that?
We got it. We got it, baby.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Working for the District Attorney.
Hold still. Why?
I saw him.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
She's too upset.
What does it look like?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Upstairs. Why?
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said I want the truth.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
...where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Sophie.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Who?
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Do you know me?
The water.
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
They were partners.
This?
Yeah?
What are you doing here?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
How's school?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes. I want proof.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
You weren't expecting me?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Father, I have sinned...
But...who...
You're still beautiful...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
How long's it been shut?
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Let's hope they like it there.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Who else you been to see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
What's happened?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Hello, Brad -
Emily!
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh yes, there is.
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Is that what you want to do?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
What?
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
What's this?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Thompson!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Unnhh!
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Beats me.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
I think you'd better leave now.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
God, isn't he great?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
I was here the whole time.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
You're just going to lock the store like that?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Look how full of yourself you are.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
With this guy locked in?
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Well, he missed!
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
What smells like shoe polish?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Five years.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
The Emperor.
It would stand to reason, yes.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
At least we're stuck here together.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Number six.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You hate people.
Broke his neck.
Shut the hell up.
Stop it.
Oh, my god.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
He made it, hunhh?
I can't fucking believe you!!
Let me borrow your car.
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
What the fuck did you do that for?
Please, get the hell out of here.
No way!
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
Then how come you got the fine?
Now I know you're lying.
Hey, what about Veronica?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
How's your eye?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Like ten after.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Just the paper.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Go open the video store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
What's that mean?
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Be careful.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
The porno mags?
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
How much money did you leave up there?
"Be there?"
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
What is it?
Thank you for being rational.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Sure. How about the beach?
I beg your pardon!
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
And... he told you all of this?
The guy ain't here yet.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I have first dibs.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
Tucker?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
Glad you could drop in.
What the hell are you doing here?!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Two...
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
You can stop right there.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I don't understand?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
A flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Gabe!?
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
Gabe...your arm?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Pull it apart!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
It's up there, on the Tower.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
No names, this is an open line!
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been punished, yeah?
Good evening, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Much better, thank you, sir.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Fine, fine.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What do I want?
I wanna be sick.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes sir.
Religion?
Do you mean Church of England?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Are you an Epileptic?
You're absolutely right, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
How many did I get right?
What's all this about sin?
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Don't read it - sign it!
Moloko-plus.
How many to a cell?
Sixth is faster.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Go ahead, say it.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
You need a vacation.
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
...he's two floors below you.
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
No.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?
What?  What did you say?
I picked up a tail.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
You guys been holding hands?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
I'm in town for a short time.
I brought you flowers.
You're gonna cheer up.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm standing right here.
You hassling my driver again?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I think he's dead.
How about the thingy next to it?
Try some deep breathing.
Music.
I can't believe this.
So what?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
You go every night?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
Gimme your wallet.
The man who hired me for this contract.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
How long have you been a hit man?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
It's what I do for a living.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Max?
What happened?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
Yes.
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
So why are they after you?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Equitation.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Please put it down.
He's why you punish yourself.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Connecticut.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
I don't understand.
Back where?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Do I know you?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
And you have no idea where he lives?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
I'm still listening.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Which way did he go?
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Agent Lowry.
Can I talk to you a second?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Is it possible...?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
What in the hell...?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
What is it?  What's happened?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Dr. Cullers?
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Could we hear to the moon?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
That isn't the way it works.
It's time to go home now.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What's that?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
Ellie.  Arroway.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Spoken like a true believer.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
How do you mean?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
But I made this arrangement --
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Buck is a deal.
Yeah.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Please! Please!
Go git it, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here, Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink.
Whatta you so happy about?
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Like I always do?
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Man, it's so hot.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
But -- but --
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
I hate this...
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
You bastard!
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where is it?
The door was already open...
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
In jail.
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Is that it?
Halloran.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
I don't want this.  What are they?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Tell me what to do!
It's a woman shot in a car?
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
I was.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
So what have we got?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
Where you going?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
You haven't told me where we're going.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Isn't that rather too close...?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Are we allowed to park here?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
What is it?
You're kidding.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I want to see my mother immediately.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
What's up with you?
Maybe.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Ruth's already taken him home.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
A while, I guess.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Guess which hand.
We're supposed to be asleep.
A daisy for the lady.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
I have a terrible confession.
I do.
So there were no problems?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
I love the pillows.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
How may I help you?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Aunt Lily?
I sure know what that feels like.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Forget I asked.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Yeah.
Are you all right?
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
Who?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
All tapped out.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Where are the tapes?
They left about a half hour ago.
No.
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Hello?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
And for my help I would get what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Hopefully no one.
He said to go fuck yourself.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
That moron.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We still have to get out of here.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Maybe you should call the police.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
What'd you guys find?
And the other car?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What hotel?
What do we do?
They don't have a wine list.
No, I didn't.
This kind.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
What happened?
No.   It's mine.
How are we going to do that?
I think we went the wrong way.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
When do we go?
You like shoes?
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Can't sleep?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Yes.
Go ahead.
Why do you want to teach me?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Do you know her?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'll give them to you.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
What do you want?
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Don't you want to see her again.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
And you're gonna tell me who.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
Mister Funboy.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
How the hell did you do that?
What the hell are you?
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
Don't waste my time.
What... the hell is that?
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
We've got company.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
Are you okay?
Thank you.
You heard me.
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Oh really?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
The Fountainhead.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
I never said that.
You don't even know me.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
You know what? I don't take it back.
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Are you shitting me?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
What are the boys like?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
That was cool.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
What do you mean?!
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Why didn't you do something?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
But I thought high school is only four years.
I like it better when I'm on top.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Don't you want to change that?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Is she with you?
Where is she?!
One.
What do you mean?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Sorry.
I don't find this very funny,
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Why not?
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
No.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
You didn't?
I'm not in the mood.
It clearly is why.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Ronald?
Not at all. What's wrong?
Let me get that for you.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
She's not here.
What time is it?
Did she show up?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Mommy --
Did your wishes ever come true?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Oh, thank you, darling.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I know that.
Something's haywire,
Did you hear the child out?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
I got lots of presents.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
What do you want. Amy?
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
Now Amy
And who did the voice belong to?
No, I didn't.
Just you wait!
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Oh, how beautiful!
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
But why?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
And does he kill people?
Hurry, hurry.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Mother! You called me by name!
Good night, mother, good night.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
What?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Jennifer?
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
George bit you?
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
So did you do it?
No, did you fuck him?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
How'd it go with the cop?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
DON'T call the police.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You expecting someone?
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
You're such a good friend.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I thought you and George were getting married.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
I know.
I'm really tired.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Uh huh. So pee.
You look different. I mean you look good.
Script coverage?
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
When's the last time you saw him?
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
You wanna get some coffee?
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Was there anything in that washer?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is it that funny?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
No, it was our first date.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
He was found a few blocks away.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
He means the last that we know of.
What are you talking about?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
How long have you been here?
Police.  Nobody move.
Why do you want to speak to him?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Iím your new assistant.
I don't know who they are.
What now?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
I didn't realise...
Someoneís after me.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Donít kill me!
Known me for long?
I'm sorry.  About before.
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Holy cow.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Choices???
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
You're fired.
Where's the girl?
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
Till what?
We think so.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Nobody's got clean kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Three years.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
And who's gonna find out?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
What happened?
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
... Sometimes they do.
How'd you get started?
Your government needs your help.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
You mean with you and everything?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
Oh... Yeah.
How were you gonna get home?
What?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yes.
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're all set,  sir.
Please....shoot me.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Sir. It's quite clear that...
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Curse?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
It's because of me.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Charlie Dalton.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Mr. Keating!
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
You know what really excites me about you?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
What happened?
That's your sister school, right?
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Too bad.
You really think I should forget her?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Father!
Weird.
What is it then?
What?
I've found it.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
So?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
You the Captain?
It's not going to help us!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
And what? These things are octopusses?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Hanover, listen...
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Got it?
Like cattle...
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Finnegan...
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
Man, don't go up there...
Or maybe not.
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
What was that?
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Fucking women, man...
Fuel up. Need fuel.
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Yes, Albert?
Nick's going?
Here's to huntin'.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Who's full of shit?
Let's go!!!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
He's real bad, Nick.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
She's in back.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Hey, guys...
Holy shit!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
No?
Sal.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
You Biederman?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Okay.
But --
What are you doing?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I thought you might be praying.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
I like it, Nick.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
That's it. No. No way.
Where's Vince?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
What's that noise?
Great. Hey. That's great.
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Where?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
I want to stop aging.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Are you a cop?
I'm ready.
They're going to rob that bank.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Can I ask you something?
Hey, buddy...
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
You want to be a good detective?
You're not pregnant, are you?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Sanchez...?
You treat her nice.
Yeah.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Howdy, Jabez.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
What do you want?
What Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Stevens!
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
Now run along, Daniel.
What's the matter with you?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Where did it come from?
Yes, why shouldn't it?
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
You know darn well it is.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
What -- what's on your mind?
It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Why of course --
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
How much?
Jabez -- help!
Down, Shep! Down!
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
But I'm glad to be home again --
You'll never change -- will you?
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Me?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
You mean -- a jury trial?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
What's happening?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
The code key, please...?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
New York...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Go on.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Roy?  You still with us?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
They way you drive, I can see why.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
How are you doing?
So... that sure is something.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
Would you do something for me? Please?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... yeah.
It's my only chance!
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Calm down, you're not ...
Sonny, be reasonable!
Yeah ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Howard, give him the keys...
You got kids?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
What?
Do you think we can turn it on?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Thanks again, Sam.
I didn't eat any pizza.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
He's gone?
You mean that?
He wants one.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Sonny -
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
What?
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
I don't want him.
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Hey, let's get ready!
Here's your document, Sonny.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?

What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.

Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.

How did you meet Choco?
Something is going down. Something bad.
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
Fast and or furious.
How you be?
I'm gonna leave now.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Mookie.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.

How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Sal's gonna be mad.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
D, not C.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Hey!  What did I say?
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
We both do.
Do we now?
No.  What are you gonna do?
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Mookie?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Shit!  I forgot.
How long then?
You a blue-moon fool.
Feels good.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--

No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
No, it's a treasure map.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.

There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
...cause you said...
Nope. I was right.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Captain Rob came back?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
Hey, it's Jessica.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
So can I come along?
You had some questions.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
TURK, leave him alone.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
That's it. I'm done.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Okay.
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
God, I've missed you.
It's the big potato.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
Knock knock.
It's a surprise.
You got the Extender?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Are you going to kill her?
My Lord!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
We have just folded space from Ix...
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
As the legend says.
Don't touch my mother...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
What's in the box?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
But you're a big star!
Are you sure this is okay?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"It is my home."
No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
You'll be sitting on the right.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
And, cut...
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Um, okay... roll camera
You really think so?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's right...
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
For this one, we need $60,000.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Can I help you?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
So have you always lived in L.A.?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Stop!
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Those assholes.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
They celebrated the common person.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What did you study?
Yes, Ed.
Leave her be.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
You said that.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
Are the TV people with you?
How's Marcia? She all right?
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
What's going on over there?
I can't?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Hey, Lou.
So?
What do you want?!
Go!
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
So...?
Where?
Okay.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Kinda'.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm making a tape.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Marcia's living with a singer?
Who is it?
Good-bye, brother!
You know what your problem is?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
I was in jail.
Check forging.
Hi.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
How'd it go?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Having a problem with your eye there?
Larry?
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Looks good to me.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
What do you mean?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
I want you to do something for me.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
So... what do you have to tell me?
And when did you do it?
Exactly when?
Which door?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
points at the motel.
Right now?
Yeah.  I'm here.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
And she's super-nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Are you crazy?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thought what?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Can I get you a drink?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Look.  I want to see you again.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
We talked.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Captain, what do you want?
<u>What do you want</u>?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
What?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Richard Stensland.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Whose shoe?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
What do you mean?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
More or less.
Anything?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
You're wrong.
No.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Something like that.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're the key witness?
Damnit...
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
What's that for?
She is Lana Turner.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
You sound like you mean it.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Do you have any proof?
It seems like my Susan, but...
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
You're back, boychick.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Have we met before?
Was it a party?
It'll be our secret.
What happened?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
What'd he say to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
You've got it on tape?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You knew the deal. No contact.
Okay.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
We lost 'em.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
Pretty fast.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Very good.
It's a little late for that.
Remain calm.
Because my life is being ruined.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
Did he give you anything?
Anything at all?
For your wife?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Bobby?
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Is Eric in school?
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I was missing you.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
That ain't me.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
It is fish.
Never.
Brill?
Thank you.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
I know.
This conversation's over.
You're a moron, you know that?
He didn't.
You're wrong.
Otherwise you may have to what?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen--
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Robert--
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Dad!
Who won the fight?
No.
Can I talk to you a second?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Yes.
Jerry--
You gotta--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Turn yourself in.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
What's your opinion?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Yes?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Actually, you sing.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
Say you're sick.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I can still taste you.
This is - what is this?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
It's so cold.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
What kind of photographs?
Safe journey.
Good morning!
Do you have your papers, sir?
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
May God make safety your companion.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
David Caravaggio.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
What do you want?
No.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
Oh.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's Canadian.
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Arguing about books.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Only we have to go to work.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Certainly not.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Mac's signature.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
That's doable.
Don't overestimate yourself.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Seems I am.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
The Empress Death Mask.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
It's a fake.
He says they turned the card down.
Motorcycle.
Those are my clothes.
I don't believe this.
Only a week?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
I'll need that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Let's do it again.
So how long to pop the floor?
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
Won't take any time.
You can't be too careful.
Careful...careful.
Okay, you're a thief.
Your share.
You've got everything planned.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Oh my god, I thought--
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's always a surprise.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Parachute.
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Four billion dollars.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Jesus.
Come on.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
You look like George Washington.
You'll just have to have faith.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Whoa.  Remind me.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
This is a real nice place you got here.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
The judge came up with a number.
I don't even know how much money that is.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Out to lunch with the girls.
You're a girl.
What are you doing here?
So what made you think it was?
I don't get why they'd do that.
Then I don't get anything either.
You think there's more?
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Someone's following me.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Is that what you want?
Whoa.  No shit.
So what are you thinking?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
What's a demur?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
And if you had to guess ...
I don't know what to say.
I did.  Both.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Hey -- those are my files --
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Which number do you want, George?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
You're around every afternoon?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
That's Ed.
About this.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Hello?
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Where's my paycheck?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
... Luke, you must not go.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Howls.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks his concern.
Yeah ...
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Because of my father, I guess.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
You, too, golden rod.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I don't know what he's talking about.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
I don't like this.
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
How's your mining operation going?
This ought to be good.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
We've got to find Luke.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
What??
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Yes, My Lord.
It won't get through the blockade.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
Zira, are you mad?
What, Lewis?
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
May I say something personal?
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
I tried...
Where is he?
I thought he was, but he came back.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
See you in hell, Snake.
That's the deal.
She's in the green.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
I said pull over.
Later.
How do you know all this?
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Snake - what is it?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Is he coming?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
But your life and lands are far from here.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
How? Where?
What book is that?
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
And you cannot love me...
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
No, no, of course not. You are young...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Now you must pay me.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's-
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Thank you.
There is nothing.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Morning.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
Oh yeah, since when?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Wanna drink.
Where's Regan's father?
What kind of stuff?
Captain who?
Regan, why are you reading that?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Yeah
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Lieutenant?
You just missed them.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Where's Regan?
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Do it again.
You speak Latin?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
Is that too tight?
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Yes
No.
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Maybe next time.
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
Piano.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Twenty years, Ma ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
So we on tomorrow night?
You look awful.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
What's with Charlie?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Sure, why not.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
What's that?
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
See anything?
Yeah.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
All night?
How dare you say you love me.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
The Royal.
April.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
What?
Be reasonable, Jack.
What disease?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Fuck you.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Right.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
How should I take it?
So run a little longer.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Where's your dress?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Save it for your wife.
They're tight.
Oh, thanks.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Give me that.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Go ahead.
Hey, we're connected.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Huh?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
How come?
Funny hours.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
He takes after our mother.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
Forget it.
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
All I said was you were good.
History.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
The recent past.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Jack.
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Jesus Christ, Castor.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Or reactivated the first one.
What do you mean?
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
No.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
Is someone there?
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Stay away from my family!
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
When did you start smoking?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Kim?
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I'm just having some fun.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
You'd have to start immediately.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
-- what?
... That's great.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
No...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Adelle?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
No.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Very nice. What is it?
Is it morning yet?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
Hey Jack, you’re all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
How'd you know my name was Jack?
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Hello!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
How can you do that?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Our life in a nutshell...
Not it...?
Jack.
Maybe I should wait...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I need to tell you something.
Good things...
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
This place is a perk, Kate.
Don’t do that...
I'm sorry...
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Mrs. Peterson.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Not by a long shot.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Can I help you?
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
That’s totally see through...
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
We had a tough year.
It's about to be a broken face.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Where...where am I?
What's wrong with me?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're on fire!
Sweet.
I'm driving.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
They're ready for you, sir.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
But I'm not done with the machine --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
For science.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
'Scuse me.
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What is it?
-- and why we need you.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Listen...the Heart.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Doctor...
What is it?  Anything wrong?
He's making a fine recovery.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
A long time, with one man.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
It's against my better Judgment...
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
You have no right to blame Duval --
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Atomic fuel?
Any reserve air?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Yes, there is.
What's wrong, Skipper?
I'll never find my way through that.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
Drop that fucking money!
This is a new car, then, sir?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Unguent.
She started shrieking, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Yah, he -
Both of these.
Oh, don't be silly.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Yah.
Where you girls from?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
A subconscious-type thing.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Jerry Lundegaard.
...Is everything okay?
Norstars.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Stan and I're okay.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
You're darned tootin'!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Yah, that's me.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...This is a nice place.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Nope.
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
...Hello?
Linda.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
...Chief Gunderson?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
This is do-able.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
You are?!
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Hmm?
It means it was homemade.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
Why are you doing this?
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I'll take the parasites.
I want brain parasites.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
I'm just on my way out...
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
There?
Here.
Make sure.
I think everything's okay here.
Is this a trick?
What did you say... ?
Marla...
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
You got about thirty seconds.
My God, you're shot...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
You were in here last Thursday night.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
I mean -- for a living.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
Would that be a problem?
Can I stay at your place?
What's that?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Same here.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
No thanks, I quit.
There's fight club in Delaware City.
I feel sick.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
I'm not asking you to.
What are you talking about?
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...to let this happen!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Fuck you.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Ask me nicely.
NO...
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Ain't that something?
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Would you rather be dead?
What about that?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
I'm not sure I understand.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
I tried calling last night but your father --
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
What on Earth are they doing?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
No.
Fag.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
That's what I'm here for.
You read me, Brewer?
What do you call that?
This place is a trip.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
What's that?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Roundeye.
I'm getting him out.
You never been in one of those things.
You better take off.
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Why's that?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
What's the job?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
What's your name?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Let's do it.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
What?
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
Oh, no..I have to get home...
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Most men are.
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Hello....congratulations.
What are you two up to?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
... What?... You don't want to commute?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Where you comin' from?!
You a friend of Parry's?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Hello Lydia?
Your name was picked.
A list.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Do you follow her every day?
Why did you do that?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
You a fag too?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Well, it's enough for me.
I don't drink coffee...
No, I...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Is it my turn again?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Sure you don't want anything?
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Hey, mack!
No substitutions.
You want me to hold the chicken.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Sorry.
I have to talk seriously with you...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yeah... I guess so...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Like what?
But what about me?
Yes, intentionally.
Swimming?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Where are you going?
I have to talk to you.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What kind of doggy is that?
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
If you want to call it that.
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
What are you doin' here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
A play-ya.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Why don't you ask Eddie?
They are?
Yo! What you goin' for
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
How do I know you're not lying.
Probably.  One of the many.
Where you know Amanda from?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Maybe tonight?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Hey you're really nuts.
What? What are you talking about?
Fletch F. Fletch
You can't keep me here.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
Margaret.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
You find the source?
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I'm still here.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
'Magic' today, huh?
Cute young thing, too.
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
John who?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
Alan's in Utah.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I mean put clothes on.
You were in the war?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Good point.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
So?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
What's wrong, Gail?
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
One.
Your call is come through.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
You're onto something. That's good. What?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
Not really.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
No, I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Did she tell you anything?
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
You wish.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
So what about this watch?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
What an interface!
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Got those Vomit invites here...
You okay?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I'm sorry...
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
What are you running from?
'Booty Time.'
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
You'd said something about proof...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
B.O.C.A.
Man, I'm clean.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Des Moines.
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Why not?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What are you saying?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
They around?
How do we get to the vault door?
How about a little of the King?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
About what?
What do you mean?
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I'm scared.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sorry 'bout that.
You call your son Little Chief?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
It's really you, isn't it?
Why?
When?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
What do I tell them?
Whatta we do now?
Yeah, you betcha.
Hang on a sec, John.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Go in where?
How you feeling?
John.  John, you all right?
Huh?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Wife around?
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
No kiddin'?
Who the fuck is this?
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Do you want a beer or not?
It's dark down there.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Come on down!
What's this?
A hammock?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
What d'ya got in there?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Is... is everything all right?
Are they following us?
This is no time to celebrate!
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
What?
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
What it is?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
There...Ya happy?
Where'd you get this?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
I know who you are.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look --
Everything going okay?
Legs giving you trouble?
Ed...
What's the problem here?
Jesus!
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
How many times do you want to hear this?
I know what it sounds like.
I didn't kill her!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Steven!
No thanks.
That was truly excellent.
What's wrong?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Where's the radio?
I doubt very much that one even exists.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I...I don't know...
I heard you weren't coming.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
What about you?
I didn't mean for you to go!
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
But Rennie...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
I opened thousands of brains.
Elliot?
We must abandon.
Is it safe?
I think we Nought to wait.
You say we go?
I'm not ready.
We're making too much of this.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
What?
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
We're able to surprise each other.
Because we're completely mismatched.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It's your best play, Nicky.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
What will we talk about?
What else?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
People are dependable.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
What do you want me to do?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
You're charming the boy.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
I don't know.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I hate the Mets.
What do you mean?
Why?
Yes.
Mine was cobalt blue.
There was a review.
Oh. You know him.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
He wears a disguise.
Home.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
It is the work of untouchables.
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Just an admirer...
What are you doing?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
What do you want?
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I would rather march.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
You mean a general strike?
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
They're sparing no one, I see.
Perhaps some tea?
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
All right. Fine.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
No?  What's keeping you?
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
That's the last.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
How often do you test, Director?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What about this?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Call German.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
Where are we going?
Everybody goes there.
How the hell did you get here.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
No bother.
Have they found our friend?
What about the car?
What is it?
--when you go away.
What's this, Lamar?
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
Hello, McCoy.
That's your problem.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Where do you want to go?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
What do you want for dinner?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's just been a while.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Yeah... I know.
Why are you laughing?
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I mean it.
What about the bank?
Doc...
They checked in.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
A man helped me open it...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
What do you want to do?
Do you mean that?
You've got it all figured.
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Are we going to make it?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
All right. Shells?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Two.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
How was that?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You do what he says, Harold.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Two years.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
A couple of weeks back.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What did you do?  Albert?
How'd it happen, then?
I made a mistake.
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Everyhing go off all right?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I call that regular.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
We went about together.
Yes, while he was here.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Tell me about the girl.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Have another?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I mean, what for?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Where would I find him?
How'd you know Albert?
What you having, Jack?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
Do us a favour?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Four hundred?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
They did.
It is.
For some sales pro...
Who?
No.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
...you're absolutely right.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Yes.
How many leads have we got?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
We're just "talking" about it.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
A job with Graff.
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I am?
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
Were the leads...
They aren't?
Will you excuse us please?
Did the leads come in yet?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who told you...?
Moss...Who told him?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Mr. Levene...?
Shelly...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...I only...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Why?
Then put me on the board.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
That's alright.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
What are you trying to tell me?
Why I don't...
Don't.
John: John:...my daughter...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
How was it...?
...yes...
Oh, Christ.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
What?
Rick...?
Ricky, I...
Yes.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
What would have elapsed?
No.  She told me "right now."
I'm...
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What power?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
You hear what I said?
Fuck you.
You just this morning...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
What took so long?
What if we don't pay?
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
I understand...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Rocco!
Goddamn it, where were you?
Me too, Tom?
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
If you need anything, just...
What was it, so I'll know.
Where's my brother?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
They can come in now.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
We've never sent this much with one courier.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
...and the tape will be running.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Whose orders are these?
Kay.
How's the baby?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I had no idea...
Where?
On a plane back to Sicily.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
However I can help you...
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Enjoy.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
Not good.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
What if I say shove it?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Thanks, doll.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You ever been married, Hanna?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
No.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
So we understand each other?
Can I see what you did so far?
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Very well put.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
This was World War I?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
What was that about?
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Did I hurt you?
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
What are you doing here?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Then the rumors are true?
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Mr....Kay?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
It seems she neglected to mention it
Who was the job for?
I think about that night a lot...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
You'll leave -- ?
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I'm on the move -
What do you want from me?
How'd it go?
It just ain't happening --
I guess ...
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Any word, Kip -- ?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
What are you doing back?
Have you seen him?
oh.
He's in some trouble ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
We'll take it...
Hey, Kip ...
You okay -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
You can handle it?
You?
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Come here -
What are you doing here?
Where'd you find this one?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What are we gonna do -- ?
You know of one -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Call 911 -
"Mitch?"
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
Ready -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Hear you roar ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What are you doing... ?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
You remember Junie?
Okay, then... Otto?
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
Why don't you leave him alone?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I warned you a million times.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Did he say what they're asking him about?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Stop brushin' me back!
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
What?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You and Morgan throw?
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Come on, Will...
Morgan, Let's go.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
What's up guys?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Codebreaking.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
It's right.  Take it home with you.
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
Can we do it at my office?
I got it.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Seems like it's going well.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
He married his cousin.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
He won't be a failure!
Sean...
So I hear you're taking some time.
Do you know when you'll be back?
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
Who is he?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
I go places, I interact.
I might understand that.
What?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Tell me what you really think.
What is?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
No.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Why not?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
They could see that I meant it.
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
I been there. I played my hand.
Gotta go with the belt there...
I know.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
See ya.
You suck.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Yeah?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
No I haven't...
Free?
I bet you have a great family.
Yeah.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Promise?
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
What about your twelve brothers?
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Ready, Ma?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Short fella. Pale face.
So long.
Want to work?
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Excuse me for asking.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
Sure do.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
How about a lift, mister?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Got any plants?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
We gonna live here?
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
That!
Know where we're a-goin'?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Got any more, Ma?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Sure. Good-by.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
They gone.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
How you get all this money?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
Now you done it! You busted it!
Can you pick peaches?
You don't...
Oh... really?
You do not.
--Stop it--
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
What's your business?
That's part of it.
Watched television?
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
You're fucking psycho.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
No time.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Is it something you've done?
I was leaving.
What if I come back?
Say more.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
What else? Say more.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
Enough?
Don't forget your identity.
This is not good.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So what happened to you?
How's that?
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You okay?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
He's beautiful.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Yeah.
How did you meet her?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Fine!
Did you ask him to come visit?
Did he mention it?
You got everything you need?
I'll come.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
When? Tonight?
Who's going to want me now?
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
Why did you go?
What did he say?
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Yeah, what?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Ha...
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Would you let me ride your horse?
She gonna be long?
What does she do?
That's not a question, is it?
Are you afraid of anything?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
"... and I said that"...
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Let's keep her.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Right.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
How was school?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I found it! I found it!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
What the hell is going on?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Your slave?
We need your help.
What?
How?
Alright, so what have we got?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Gill.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Mr. Belford?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Any questions?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What the hell was that all about?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Thank you.
What number please?
You're late.
We need to talk.
What?
What's going on?
Is there another key?
Shit!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
I do.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Sure it does.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel come on.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
What are you doing out here alone?
You don't believe that do you?
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You remember Lindsay don't you?
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Call me.
Where are you going?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Why?
When he makes that call.
Where's that Deputy?
Okay.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
It's been totally charted.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Shit!
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
You still spooked?
Lies.
Fancy.
I don't know.
I wonder where they went.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Want a beer?
We're all alone, aren't we?
Yeah, sure.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
A man wouldn't do that...
Exactly what do you need?
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
They could be.
TOTALLY!
Can we watch the monster movies?
No...
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
The bogyman!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
How?
PROBABLY going.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
It means... I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Oh, yeah.
We're a big hit.
It's French, though.  It really is.
You're joking.
Is this your first job?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
And it's just in one ear?
How ya doin', man?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Like, uh...?
Oh, my goodness!
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, you-you have that one?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Elliot!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I thought you weren't coming.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
And you're in love overnight?
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Oh, Mom!
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
Me?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Why?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
You're just realizing this now?
No.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Ohh!
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Perfect!
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
Oh, Hannah!
Oh, he's such a loser!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Ohh!
Hey, hi!
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
You're too demanding.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter?
My script?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
God!
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Good.  How are you?
I'd never do that.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
No, the reason I ask is--
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You're kidding me.
You're okay, though, huh?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Really?
Really?
Oh, God!
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
...you...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How was America?
...nightmare.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Hold up a minute...
<u>Do</u> it...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
No. 
I am all attention.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
...Franklin.
You were given backup....
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...which of us is free...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
You should get Married.
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
Fine, thank you, but
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
"Because we don't have any money."
Hello....?
...<u>sadly</u>...
...what a lovely perfume.
What're they on about?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Then tell me.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
...yes...?
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
My encounter.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
Do you really not believe in God?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Veronica, you look like hell.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
Shit.
Probably....
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Killing her won't solve anything.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Good plan.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Did you miss him completely?
We killed them, didn't we?
Your son's dead and you love him.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
This knife is filthy.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Hello!
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Bye, Dad.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Of course, yes.
It's inside a moving car.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
No.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Since what?
GWEN?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Hello I'm Dr...
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Morgue...?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Do you know where you are?
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
-Tawny.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bill, listen...
The homeless!
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
What's the matter?
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
Oh my God!  Bernie!
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I didn't ask him.
Safety?
Hey, c'mon.
Where are these toys of yours?
Are you being helped, sir?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
About what?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Whew.
Honey --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You could have a pool to cool off in.
We're going to think about it.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
He wants to see me!
Who was that?
What?
Let's follow 'em.
It's fun.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Promise?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Detective Bedsoe.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Yes -- I think it is.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
As friends -- always as friends.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Yes.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Agreed.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Different places.
Why?
Yes.  How did you know?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
No.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Would you like to see it?
On the back it has--
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
How can that be?
What will you do?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
What'd you find out?
You should warn them, Sonny.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I guess not.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Jesus.  What is this?
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
That you, Talley?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
The cops are comin'!
What the fuck is that?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Donuts here any good?
What if it goes south?
How did you get this number?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I'm scared shitless.
No one's coming.
We can't carry him.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What do you want?
What?
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
What happened?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What's my name?
What are you people going to do?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
Can you open them?
Where are my children?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you find the disks?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
What happened?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
You want to pay me?
They fired a rocket at us.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
The United Nations are still here.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
He did.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Where are they going?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I committed no war crimes.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Let’s go, Jock.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
The commander is not here.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Was there blood?
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Thomas wants advice?
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
You could leave, Paul.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to go out to get food.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
Please, please try one more time.
We have to have a plan.
Oh, my babies.
Can I have your name again?
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What do we do with all these people?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Out? Where are you going?
Paul, are you there?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Looks like we're it.
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
I'm sorry --
Oh, really: who?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
-- closed.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
There's always exceptions.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
You hear somebody?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
I was upstairs with Eddie --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
Where did it go?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Please! I need your help.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
Rewind that.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Excuse me?
For the love of God....please...?
Did you find something?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Well then who did?!
It's going to hurt us!
Are we leaving mommy?
She's here.
Help me!  Please!!!
I want this one, daddy.
What's he doing daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Oh my God!  She's in there!
What will Aubrey think?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
God rest her soul.
The heater's here.
But do you agree with me?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
How are we doing?
Aubrey!
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
You don't think I know?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Maura, what is this!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
We don't know.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
What was she afraid of?
We'll never know for sure.
Keep talking!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
What's going to happen?
Where did you find this?
Not on station time.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
What will he do?  What does he want?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Wha .... ?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
But I don't know what's going on.
Sure.  Why?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
What am I looking for?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
But you gave me a rose ...
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Joey?
Oh, I don't ...
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Yeah right.  Look ...
Really?
That was beautiful.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Oh, you read that.
And I'll bring my entourage...
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
I was the Warden?
What have you been doing?
Catholic girls are scary...
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Bunny, not you too?
Don't be stupid...they...
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
If you do anything to my friend...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Daddy-Oh!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
About seven minutes.
-- and she's dynamite!
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
...You know! For kids!
...What happened?
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
I got big ideas, though!
Terrific.
How long've you been down here?
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
...Why, this is worthless.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
But, Buzz --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Yessir.
Sir?
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
You're fired.
But --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Not that way! Through the door!
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Ya don't say.
How's that, Sid?
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Yellowstone.
Maybe he's wise.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
I'd love to.
Mrs. Rand.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
Does she suffer?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
You're single?
The West Indies?
-- But, you're an American?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
That doesn't sound like him.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
No, Wes.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I suppose so.  Yes.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
Investigation of what?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
I have no idea.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
If you're going to insult me --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Grades?
What are you talking about?
Talking to me, dad?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- What advice? You never --
But...
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
You okay?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Oh.
I used to know how to cook.
Here you are.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Reverend Edwards.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Huh?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Jesus, Jim!
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Maybe you should have just a half.
I do.
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Where you going?
Did you tell Sandy?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Why did you -- with Sandy?
You're parents at that party?
You get in trouble?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Hello, Charles.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
I love you.
Nice kid.
So far.
Do it again.
I could say the same thing about you.
Who's playing?
Thanks.
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
No.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Where you signed this?
Randy Stetz?
They're all over everybody.
You know my plan of action.
He's just rattling your cage.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No way.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
Fred Duggar?
Will...I...
One of your cases?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Stuff.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Down at the station?
No.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
Monstrous.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
I was waiting for you...
Then blame the one who made her...
I couldn't prevent it.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
I'm not your daughter.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Claudia! You did that?
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
What was that?
How do I look?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You know her?
This is monstrous!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You've just done it -
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Did I hear a yes?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
You fool, what have you done?
The girl, Lestat -
Lestat - finish this -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
It's only a siren...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Storm season?
Listen to me. He's here.
I want off this island.
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
The number's unlisted...
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
But, he said he'd try.
Karaoke -- perfect.
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Julie?
Ray, I can't...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Ray...what are you doing?
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm sorry.
Deep breaths --
You sure it's okay with you?
What do you mean, Julie?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
I trusted you.
...Why?
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Is there a problem here?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
Goodbye.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Oh, no -— it's too delicious! You're making it up!
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
You are fortunate in your father.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
What would I be thinking?
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
What is her illness?
You know that sound, Oliver?
It makes me fear her.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
But they're somebody's children.
Get that ladder up here.
Good morning, sir.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?
What did you stop it for?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You sent for me, sir?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Thank you very much.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
What?
Daddy!
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Is it a charge, sir?
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
George.
Hey, George . . .
Where are you going?
George, can I see you for a second?
No, George, don't . . .
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Me?
I'm not very good at this.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
I'll take it. And then what?
How's that?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Mary! Mary!
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How about that one there?
I can't wait to get there.
Don't!
Why not?
Shut up.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Coming up!  Give way!
I thought you said she was going with us?
Chief....
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Chief?
What about that camera?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Mike's out there.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Let's get the kid home.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
I know what you're going to say.
Sean's asleep.
Because of today?  The beach?
I'll give notice.
What is it?  What's the matter?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Are you serious?
Bullshit.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Did he raise the Kids?
Hi Dad.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Anyone know what time it is?
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
What about sailing?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
I don't care.
What about me?
Not tonight.
Wave to my son.
Oh, my God....
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
He's going with you, Doctor.
It's Miller time!
You called, Doctor?
How come?
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Not enough loving.
Damn it!
It's romantic down here.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
You're going down there again?
Kathryn...
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
You want me to stay?
They said you'd be here.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Come on.
Yes, you can.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
I am.  You're not.
You don't have to prove anything.
I told you, something's upset them.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
I will.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Not at all.
I think they'll come out now.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Musclehead?
I'm a water-skier.
Take it up.
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
Gotta sneeze.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yes, there is goes.
Yeah, well I didn't!
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
The world's southern most reaches.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
That's impossible.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
She still talking to you?
You want to show this?
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Where have you been...?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
It'll grow on you.
That hurt....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
I never....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
You're coming, aren't you...?
Sit down, Ma....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
No....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
Still tagging conch?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Stop farting around....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Hey!
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
When I got the grant.....
Okay...we got it together....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Stop that!
You told me what?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
It's my fault...I have to....
Jake.
She's in management....
Cow tipping?
Did you like that, Mama?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
Not for me ..
How's the new residence?
There's nothing in the files?
You gotta stop smoking ..
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
We're going.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I haven't got it.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
What do you want it for?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Why's she blind, Bro?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
What if we need a back up?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Did Amber have a dog?
Have you been here long?
No.
Just your age.
Why can't I stay with you?
Why?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
I think they're gonna arrest me.
You got a warrant for this?
What does that mean?
You think John would like it?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
You want something, darling?
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Who told you?
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
This can't be happening to me.
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
... light.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Me too.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Oh God.
What --
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Why do you love me?
I don't like to give up.
Wait. Where is he?
That's the girl I love.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
At last I find you.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Rod --
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
--  the kwan.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I'm asking you a question --
I'm sorry I asked.
I'll go back to them.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You wanted smaller.
They do, my brother.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
He says it's a bad idea!
You hate to swim.
Udesky.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
I don't remember
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
He could have died.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I don’t know.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
We could co-write a paper.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
I CAN GET HIM!
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Good luck with the fund raising.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Why?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
How did you know?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
What are you talking about?
I'm not going, John.
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is that?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
There' no reason for name calling.
No.
What are they?
Come on!
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Oh, God.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
These formations.  They're dried --
So what's your story, Nick?
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Pretty sure.
Did I say jerk?
And what are those?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
So what are you thinking?
Constantly sick.
- - like birds - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
Are you sure?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
It's all right.
No.
I know, it's very exciting.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Alan, listen to this.
Oh, imperfections?
Can we chance moving him?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
What'd I touch?!
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I didn't say you were scared.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Oh my God!
Can't you stop these things?!
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Dad - - Dad - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
Tim, Tim, Tim....
All night?
Go away!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
I'm a hacker!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
Fifty.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Quite a circus.
What's going on?
What are the charges?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Doesnit sleep?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Fascinating.
Uh-huh...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You're not going to be there?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
What are you doing?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Are you all right?
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
Where do you live?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
You look like brothers.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
When I have no reason to doubt.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Probably not.
Do you?
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
... A piece of paper ...
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
It's gone out so quickly?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I'm sorry ...
I can't imagine you crying.
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Man Eater!!!
What was it, Jack?
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Did you fear for your life?
Are you gonna start it up?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Sure dear, yes.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
Oh no, I don't think --
Who?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Well do you think it was him?
What're you gonna do next?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
The same as Jane McKenna.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Is that all you have to say?
I called Trina.
Mm.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
What?
I can't follow you.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Have you discussed this with them?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You're late.
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
I'm sorry...
Is mom ever coming back?
See you in the morning light.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
Sustained.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Did you wish to?
Objection!
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection!
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
I don't recall.
Is that...permanent?
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I'm not taking him with me.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Wow!
'Night, Jim.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Oh, Christ!
I lost him?  I lost him?
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
What are you going to do?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
You ever think about getting married again?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
California?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
You heard anything yet?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Hey, that's terrific.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
I will buy them for you.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Dalai Lama.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
Yes.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
I will be back in a few days.
Do I have money?
Is that big?
Where is Alsace?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Britain chooses not to.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
Do you think I must?
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
We have enemies.
I do.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Like my mother.
You killed him.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Go!!!
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I do <u>not</u> like you.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
No!
Where is he?!
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Where?  Where?
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Such the flirt.
He was an Indo-pacific.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
And how would we neutralize him?
Did you make anything of the tooth?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
It's too dangerous for--
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Like little children.  You okay?
Sorry.
No thanks.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
Are we crazy?
He's mooing.
Get him onto shore.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
It was... something meeting you.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Yes.
I wouldn't.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
What is this?
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
<u>You</u>?
<u>You</u>?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Yes.
Go, Doctor.
The death of my father.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Then tell me how.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
My God, you've grown up.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
You do not know what you are saying!
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Some say that's the way of it.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Yes. Go ahead.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
What?!
And if we're unlucky?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
The honors of war?
Qui vive?
Le mot d'ordre?
What's wrong?
Why Sixpack?
They found this?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Go on!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
How's astronaut training?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
Shit!  He sent them all.
What about our quota?
Okay, number 23's full.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Yes sir...
What happened?
Listen to it for Christsake.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
It's Sixpack!
How'd you do that?
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
How is he?
What is it?
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
How much did you part with?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
I thought this was a pub.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
I don't know what you mean.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
JD.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
It's not him, Dad.
Yeah?
We gotta get those guns.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Yeah, one of them's out.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well, what's going on?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
I will.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you doing, Plank?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How many wings have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Please.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
How's business?
I hear they're closing that post down.
You were in a fight--
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Same as they done in Mexico.
PDA?
Well--
Didn't have a father?
Tanks, huh?
Are we going to ever see your father?
Something like that.
This place is a gold mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Hey, Mikey--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously.
Treasure hunter?
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Yeah. I bet he would.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
So.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
That's a matter of interpretation--
That so?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
Bledso
Besides my father, I mean.
Charley Wade.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
Steve called for you.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Right. When he was killed.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
He squeezed money out of you?
What about it?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
You gonna stay out here?
She finally got in--
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Got him here?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
People liked him.
Your boy, there--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I should get back.
I mean what did we know about anything?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Yeah?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
We start from scratch--
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
That's Butterfield...
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Thanks, Billy.
Death.
I'll tell you.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Oh Christ.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
Oh God!
No!  No!  No!
Valentin?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
... they believe you.
Are you finished with me?
With what?
Shit.
Then what do you want?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Philip Swann?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
D'Amour --
Don't bother.
The Puritan?
That.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Oh yeah?
Oh Jeez.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
This is where we killed him.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Swann?  What are you doing?
And?
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
What are you doing here?
What did you study?
Hi again, how's it going?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Charlotte, who?
Of course.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
You are.
You made it.
What happened to your toe?
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
So, where'd you go today.
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Uh, no.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
When are you coming home?
Hello?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
See you later.
Uh..thanks.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Yes.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Is he going to be okay?
What is it?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You killed my parents.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Oh my God!
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I do.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Trick him.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Peter, let go of the chair!
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
There's nothing else here.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
What can I do?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
He was trying to tell me something.
Oh, Peter.
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
He can see you Thursday.
Yeah.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
He could see me.
Ah, Mom.
I hate it.
That's not funny
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
Okay.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
I can take it.
Careful.
Wait...
You could make a career by telling me where.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
I don't wanna see that.
You might be the only one with a job.
That too tight?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I told him you looked like me.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
I know.  But chances are...
Hey, munchkin.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
I know.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
So...does it hurt?
Your Dad play?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't know.  A lot.
You do act different.
I think we gotta kiss now.
So?
I don't have to do what you say.
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Guess not.
Four.
What was that about?
You finish the reading for E-con?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Then prove her wrong.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Hey.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You don't think so?
So that's it, just forget about us?
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You asked me what was missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
You scared me.
Guess he talked to you.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
You work too hard, Pop.
Sorry.
What's Mom think?
From your mouth.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
What kind of Cancer?
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
...what the fuck is this...?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Yes.
No.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
What are you lookin' for?
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Just Jim.
Eight o'clock?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Billingsley's?
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You really use strong language.
It's fine.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
Yeah.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
-- you the resident here?
You live alone?
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
Can you hold it?
What happend, what's going on?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
Did you listen to me?
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
What?  What does that mean?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Picky, picky.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I paid you back.
What is that?
I don't know.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...cocksucker....
Do me a personal favor --
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
And your father?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Is he in pain?
He's in here --?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You're just come in --
You're here.
I didn't do anything.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
What happend to you?
Slowly or quickly?
That's it.
Just once.
I don't know....
I think that you know.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
No.
Are you on drugs right now?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Hello.
Partridge?
mmm.hmm.
Bottled Water?
Ok.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Be ready at two --
You coulda been in front --
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
What is that?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
My Queen...
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Louis, please -- !
Your Majesty...
Wh-- Wha--
It can.  I know the way.
What is that?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Where are you going?!
A simple theological discussion.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Mother of God!
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
It worked!
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Thanks, but not for me.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Recent hours have been a shock.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is that?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
Phillippe...?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Silence!  I order you!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Your Majesty...?
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Continue.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
Phillippe!
Magnificent valor...
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Exactly why it should be given away.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
You can cut the shit, asshole--
What did the six-toes have to say?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Find out for me.
I'll take the south end -
Alright, where is she?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Something I don't already know?
Why did you set me up?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Ditched you?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
What about him?
It was you who did the asking.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Get him to Atlanta.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
For Christ's sake, why?
Who did he ask for?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
What'd it say?
Will?
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Will...?
I'll cover the back.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
How did you come to Gateway?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Is that you. D?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I'll see you later. All right?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
What am I doing here?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
She'll be in, in the morning...
Yeah...
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's misunderstood.
He's very strong physically.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Hello, hotshot!
At the store. You doin' some good?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Blue is cold.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
What will you do?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Maybe we should give it some time...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
How did it happen?
She got all right?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
Pray tell.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Do you have the file with you
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
What were the yards like?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
You have to do it.
Andy?
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
How long would they let me sleep?
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
Really?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Right...
Hi...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Hi...
Popcorn?
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
How can you be so casual??!
You're not listening to me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Hey Andy, good show.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Excuse me, Andy...
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
We had a deal!!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Can I help you with something?
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
Bob.
They are dead.  In either case --
Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
That's the third white van I've seen.
You don't, do you?
Hello, Trinity.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Do you always look at it encoded?
Why you're here?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Five.  Since I've been here.
Yes.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
Give me your phone.
How long?
Who's coming for me?
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How does she know?
And she's never wrong.
She helped you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Did you believe in them too?
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Now left and that's it in front of you.
I'm going to make the call.
You're the Oracle?
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
What's funny?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
Who is?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
What does that mean?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What?
No, you're not.
Can you fly that thing.
Zion?
Cypher, I thought --
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
Neo!
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Look at her.
So?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
It's the truth, I swear.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
I think we should see your uncle.
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
You getting out too?
How much?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time.  I don't care.
You know why...with my parents.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Hey... you got stereo.
Yeah, it's your father's.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Just plain 'Joe'?
I know you do, darling.
-- Black.
I don't like cake.
Oh, the goddam party --
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I wasn't going to say --
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Paillarde of veal.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Yes, sir?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
I didn't say.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Is there any more to it?
No.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Whose?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
You're overthinking it --
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what he said.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
Doctor lady make it irey.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
I am.
She knows how she feel.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
The Board is waiting.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Goodnight, Joe.
I appreciate you --
I mean I appreciate that.
How long have you been standing there?
No, I'm not.
Almost.
Thank you.
I - uh --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
That's it?
You think so?
Joe, that's the kitchen.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
When you go, I go.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Bill --
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
I want to live.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
And more.
Why did you go to the hospital?
Hello, Bill.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
Yes, I saw you see me.
I'll be the judge of that.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I'm sorry, Bill --
So that's what love is?
Joe, don't do this --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
Yes.
I think you know --
Where are you?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
About what?
Get what?
Yes what?
The 'question' --
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Good morning, Dad.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Daddy, what's the matter?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
What?!
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Where is he?
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Why?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
You said you liked me.
38.
79.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
30.
You don't know?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
So you're holding my calls?
No, let's go.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Do you remember me?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Yeah.
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
What?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What do the police think?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
They're not looking for him.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
My boyfriend told me about you.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Shut your mouth!
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
You don't know him?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
I didn't sell -
Why?
Envelopes?							    *
What's wrong?
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
No, you won't.
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
It is now.
* Thank you.							    *
Yeah.
Yeah?
Where's the new drop point...?
What do you think?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain...
You need to consider a few issues.
I got the item.
What's "nothing"?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Mojitas...?
You know how improbable this is...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Would you find me...?
Is this the protective male talk?
What...?
Red light, green light, José?
Yeah?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
And there's Dmitri...
Stevens?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
To the limit.
Like...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
What's your take?
Eleven to seven he blows it.
Detective Crockett.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Never heard of him.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
On the phone.
Alonzo...!
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
You sure?
What flowers?
Okay.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
Equipment?
The Statue of Liberty.
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Forget it.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You got a comb?
Tell her, Ratso.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
Hey, what the hell you doing?
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
What d'you want?
Listen, I gotta have money.
Here. Don't even thank me.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
It's there!
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
You know where they are?
Those mountains? are they?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
No, I'm not afraid.
Yes...?
Yes.  I think so.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Got a family back there?
Just Erich.
Oh we... we...
Whose?
It's already been cut.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Lawyers?
What lawyer?
Hey, you can't...
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Oh, that's gonna work.
I only got...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Can we get this car there?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
He was just doing his job.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Sure.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
Here.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
But what?
No, what is it?
Pretty rough so far.
The profanity bothers you?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
I hope you like it.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
Don't talk to me like that.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I thought you were going to dinner.
Where is it?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
What was the top bid?
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
We're due to take off.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
What can we do' mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
So where did I got right?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Just like old times?
Where do I meet you?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
No.  Should I?
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Excuse me?
Yes, I believe that's right.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
A visit from an old friend.
You have Bellerophon.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Did we get it?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
May I come in?
I didn't say that.
I just need you to be safe.
What are you going to do?
Two cars.  Where are you?
This is Kittridge.
I donít think so.
What?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Claire.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Why not?
How was Chicago?
You're going to use Walter?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure.  If the main character does.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Whatís going to make him do that?
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
You got it.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
What's going on?
Yes...  Itís him.
Have I been a good wife?
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You're not sleepy?
The guy died.
He got hit by a bus.
You're married.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Why you looking around so much?
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Why didn't he call himself?
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
When you get engaged?
No.
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Stop it!
A bride without a head!
Son of a bitch!
To the bed.
I was dead.
What? What have we done?
I'm marrying your brother!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Why not?
Who painted that?
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What's the matter?
You're making me feel guilty again.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
Why not?
You've gotta get outta here.
No, I'll tell him.
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
You don't want the fish.
What's the matter?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I like this ring.
How near is she to death?
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
WHAT?
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
No. But I have a hangover.
Hi, Loretta.
Don't fight.
Don't make yourself sick.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Maybe I should go?
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm sure she did.
Yes?
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Go ahead.
May I walk with you a ways?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Who are the Britons?
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
A what?
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Too late.
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Sorry ...
Yes, Lord.
Make a bridge out of her.
I feel fine.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
They cost fifty pounds each!
Gosh - Is he all right?
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
If we ... er ... 
Make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
I done it again.
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
Aye, but will they?
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
And she sent no word down?
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
Hey, Barney.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
Convey her a message.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Gesture?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
You'll be sent a message.
Awaiting my orders.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
That can wait till the weekend.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What brings you here?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Too busy looking after themselves.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
John?
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Ma'am?
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Is that not enough?
We're going to lose.
What's her excuse this time?
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Well?
How long has he been this sick?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
I have a letter, ma'am.
What is the matter with him?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
Where to now?
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
The Police, then...
You mean we learn the rules...
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
You don't get it, do you?
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
Shit...
We can't reach that!
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Mom?  You're alive...
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
What do you mean "you know"?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Your Aunt called me.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
There was an accident. I came here.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No. Just the coffee.
"Really?"
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
To my audition.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
It's kind of embarrassing but,
I had a dream about this place.
You see what I mean...
You feel it?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Why should we trust you ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
So what do we do ?
First Bank ? But how ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
An elevator ?
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When I think you're ready.
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
What's next ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
The power went out in half the park.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Hello.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
I think we should follow him...
Are you okay ?
How's your foot ?
What now ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
You had to remind me?
Do you still teach?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
This is California, anything is possible.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Do what?
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Seriously.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
No nuns, got it.
Yeah.
I will. How's Shelly?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Reason? What reason?
Maybe he's wet?
Thanks.
I told you it was a long story.
I know that.
What are you staring at?
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Thanks
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Thanks....
He said it was a gift.
Vada.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Boyfriend?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
You mean,  this ring?
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
Hey look!
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Maybe.
A secret, I like that.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I'm just tired.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
Let me hold him.
Beidermeyer?
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
It's there.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
It's still available I hope?
I need the job.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
This is where we are.
Rock?
Kiss me.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
How's it going chef?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA!
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Goodnight Vada.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Are they ready yet?
Hi Vada.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Do you miss her?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Do you like her?
Shut your big fat mouth!
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Did you read ALL these books?
What are they about?
Are you married?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I like my name.
Where's Daddy?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
At what?
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Naah, I don't wanna.
Is that your Dad?
Who's that with your Dad?
Do you remember her?
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
THIS!! 
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Uh huh.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
For what?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
You flew all the way h...
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
You're going to say it, aren't you?
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
Don't you have to be somewh...
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
And the answer was so simple.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I saw the show.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Is anybody watching?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, sure.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
You miss her, huh?
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
What's up?
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
You're from out of town?
Barnett, please -
I don't want to listen to her sing -
You have to what?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
What did you say your name was?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
He has that sign with the tree.
Okay, then we'll see you there.
What's he running for?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Where are you going?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Well, Mr. Green.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
You want me to wait?
What?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
You know anything about the stations here?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Mom?
Nashville.
The car broke down.
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I don't think so.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Who is this?
When did you think it would happen?
Thirty?
You know who that is?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
They said go see the chaplain.
Oh, no.
Where are you going?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I'm Opal.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
He is to a lot of people.
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I know a couple.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
You think it will?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Mickey!
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
How is it?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Manson beat you.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Says the United States of America.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Just wait one fucking minute.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
I admire them.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Only on a much grander scale.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Take a wild stab!
How immediate is immediately?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Who?
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
How's it working, Scotty?
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
How 'bout that furniture plant?
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Thanks.
How 'you doin' man?
That's two bucks, Joe.
I'm a teacher.
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Ain't your fault.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Goin' to see my kid.
That's right.
What's he like?
Hi.
Your boy.
Thank you.
What about him?
Is that so?
Everything you cook is good.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Okay.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
'You Will Anderson?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Seems a little loose!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
What did you say, boy?!
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Hello.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Now you stay put!
Got a thick feelin' here.
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Take this off.
You're hurt...
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What's this?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Ready?
Never heard of him.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You haven't got it?
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
How long have I been out?
I gotta know... did it work>
How soon is soon enough?
On a good run... yeah.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
It sounds like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
I'll get the car.
Yeah... fine.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
My God... these people are insane.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Who?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
How long will they watch us for?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
No Roger from op/ed?
Who told!
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
How about this?
Cuuuute!
You need my help?
What is this?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
How many times have I fired her?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Do you even know these kids?
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Gus?
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Oh.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
You're twenty-three years old!
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I love the way she writes.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
You have to say that. You're my student.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
That is so sad --
He <u>has</u> to know...
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Taste it.
Why not?
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
You got your room straightened out yet?
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
I'll kill you now.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Are you nuts or something?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You okay?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
I think it's sad...
Are you okay.
What is this place?
What is it - What's wrong?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Who, Jesse?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
'Morning.
Hi, guys.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I'll need to take her things.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
What?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
I don't know...
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
It's over.  It's over.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
That's what I know.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
The truth.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
C'mon.
Why is he after us?
We're here.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Wait a minute.  What about me?
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
God, that's an enormous arse.
And then I... right.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Okay -- fine.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Busy tomorrow?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Whoopsidaisies.
I'm sorry.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Eleven.
Yup.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You like Chagall?
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Well...
Can I stay a bit longer?
What?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Where are you going?
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Bloody hell, this is fun.
I was called and I came.  What's up?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Ahm... room service.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
That's right -- Topol.
Martin -- your customer.
Buggered?
Hello.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
What's going on?
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
On this ward?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
That's it! We made it!
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
Welcome back.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
A bus?
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
What is it, kid?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Say it again.
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Yeah, where we going?
It's the questions she asks.
What?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
What are you doing?
Did to me?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
So why are you talking to him?
I'm busting outta this place.
I'm the coach!
Why not?
Hit me!
I wanna see it...
I wanna go home!
Jesus God...
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
I don't, Doc...
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
When?
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
You look pretty healthy to me.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Got a cigarette?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Hey, how ya doin'?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Bet!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
She was your sister.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Were they pen pals?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Good.
We found each other, didn't we?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Congratulations.
That's not the point.
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
Why?
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
So.  You found him.
Hey--
What?...
Why are you doing this?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
Is something the matter?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
So what do you think?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Why don't you ask him?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
But what?
I have vacation time coming to me.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Ah ha!...
A phone message.  Only--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
That was a long time ago.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
I never even got to be single.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
Peter found him?
Whatareyoudoing?!
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
And he is living proof.
Maybe I can change him.
Kate is that you?
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
What about Larry?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
It's siesta.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Huh?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
And you didn't tell her?
I'm gonna take her home first.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
Well, where are they?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened?  What happened?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
You know how the Sisters are.
I want to be a teacher.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I'd better go in.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
You haven't finished your beer.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
It's true.
I don't rate it.
You... .
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Thanks just the same.
My pigeons... .
Every one of 'em... .
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Where you goin'?
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
...walk?
D 'n D?
You still call it ratting?
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I think you could have.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
You was a Golden Warrior.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You got some nerve.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
In there.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Can't we get out of here?
What do you mean?
The ropes are coming loose.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
But they are not yet one of us.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
The moon is almost gone!
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The time...is short.
You may take her now.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
No. No! No!
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
Ask him his name.
You're good.
You were his what, his box?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Nice disguise.
Let's go to Detroit.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
Shut up.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
You get the key?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Quite a mess.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
So you've done this before, huh?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
How'd you get this number?
That's my dad.
Why not?
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Oh, God...
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You coming back?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
So.  What's your point?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
Thanks for your help.
Really?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
There were others.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Take the next exit.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
That was some shit, huh?
Hi, Ray.
You're a fighter?
Flyweight.
No.
Was a she, name Tuffy.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
I really gotta go.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
You gonna go get him?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
You here all by yourself?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Foley's got it.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I think he must've fell in.
I found a rubber.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
I wish she could forget him.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Nervous?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Sorry.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
You hear my okay?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
How's everything?
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
How'd you get this?
What's your name?
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
What else can we do?
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
What's the matter?
We're here on the sofa bed...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Want me to drive you home later?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, how are you?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
I'm sorry Charlie.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What're you doing here?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Terry! Slow down.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
You don't?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Does everybody have to hear?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Would you get that, dear?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What are you doing?
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
That's Renee alright.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! How was your first day at school?
I think so.
Who was that?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
You want me to help?
How did it go with your father last night?
Mom...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Thanks, Walter.
Thanks, you guys.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Jerk... What did you say?
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
I'm not ready to die.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
Congratulations.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I buy that.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
PARRTYY!
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Opera?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Mom?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
How many gays do you know?
You taught him a lesson.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Let's continue.
Julius!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Don't wanna miss this.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You did this? To yourself?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
What do you see? Riddick?
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
How many you see?
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Just give me your hand.
You barely know them.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....
What, switch what?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Well, don't ask me to.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
I don't suppose....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
One is all?
Imam. Slow down.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
And pointless.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Such as.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Seal the cave?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
Look -- she remembers.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Geiger counter?
No.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
This place is dirty, doctor.
He's trying to form words.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Who are you?
I want her.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I told you not to bring the other one.
What is that?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
One is in a museum!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ThatÕs a lie!
Sustained.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Twelve hundred years ago.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
You! ... You knew about this?
Taylor! Tell him.
He's moving his fingers!
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
So what's the problem?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Yeah?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
Come on man!
First time?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Okay - got light duty, three days.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
What are you talking about! 
Whew! - where that come from?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Right on.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Right...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Okay. You win.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Bad?
What time is it?
Want to dance?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Then he's got to be a detective.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mitchell was dead enough.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
I think you mean that.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
We try to be decent.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
All right, let's see the buzzer.
How are your teeth getting along?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
The usual grind.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
The only answer I have for you.
It could have been an accident.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
Passkey?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
What do I get for it?
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
No suicide.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
No doubt about that one.
He checks too.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
No.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
How long have you had it?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Be nasty.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Oh yes?
I called you a taxi.
Why not stay?
In radio we're different.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
In your car
Not yet you know any of these people?
And the Argies.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
How you figure?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
I can't do this.
I'm not armed.
Why should I?
Wild ride, huh?
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
What?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
They don't go for the vault?
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
... so I started tailing him.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
They're on their way to Maui.
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
Nice place.
What's goin' on?
My name's Johnny Utah!
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Why us?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
That's over the border, General.
Mmmnnn...?
What's he got?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Georgia.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Your uncle will like this.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
That's ridiculous.
Stolen?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Three hundred.
Get in.  This side.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
And why do you say that?
Where are they?  Shopping together?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
You still mad at'm?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
What if someone tries to steal it?
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
What's up, where you going?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
I want to.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
You're being ridiculous.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I don't think there's any sense in --
What!?
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
'Lo.
He... he just does.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
What's your name?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Hi, Barney!
Yeah, well, I check out today.
May I help you?
Would you like to try it on?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I killed him myself.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
We did it.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Why is that, do you think?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
The Man in Black?
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
A book?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
-- wait, just wait --
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Who gets Humperdinck?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Could this be a trap?
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
No.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sorry.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
How old were you?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
You're just stalling now.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
What's so funny?
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
You feeling any better?
Guess what.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Yes sir.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Yes, what?
I'm not going to jump on you!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Maybe you're happy.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
It won't run a week!
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Don't help me.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Min Bialystock.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
You, Blum go Motel.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Like clockwork.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
No. At least I don't recall.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No.
No.
No.
What?
Cash.
I live there. Alone.
Now, look...!
What's your interest?
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
I'm in no mood for trouble!
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
Please!
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
Did he say anything about my sister?
What's the matter?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Why do you ask that?
You should... mind it.
No, not like me.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
Oh?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
...Forty thousand dollars!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Just before she died she came to--
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
What's that?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Let me go! Let me go!
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
That's the one.
What do you mean police dog?
I told you he was a sore.
He might get some publicity out of it.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
I see. Was that all she said?
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
How much money have you got?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Is that a fact?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
Shall we unpack it?
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Could you?
Could be.
Of what?
What did it want?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Why?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Actually, I am, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Neither do I.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
What's goin' on?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
Turn up your hearing aid.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Quarter of twelve.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
How is she?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
You don't know where you're going?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Um-m, well...
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
What's the matter with him?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, you run on now.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Jiminy Christmas.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
Dean Martin.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
They... they shot me.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
You could start over again with cash like that.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He tried to kill us.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
He went to pick up lunch.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Get his attention.
What the hell's his problem?
You suck at lying, Archie.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yes, my Master.
As you wish.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I have felt him, my Master.
Han!
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
What's going on?
I...
I'm sorry.
Yes.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
We're coming!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
I'm going in.
There it is!
Ugh!
Oh!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
Then you know why I have to face him.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
How many languages do you speak?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He might be.  I don't know.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh Janet
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You did right.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
What guy
On the day I went away.
Want to come again and stay
Oh, no no, no no.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Looks quiet, y'know.
Some people are very shy by nature.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
I always knew you was pretty.
'Bout seven.
Don't you open them anymore?
I thought it might be cute.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
He got lucky.
Damn.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
This a con?
Nine minutes!
That's ten bucks.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Ya sure?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Rocky, would you be interested in --
I'm sure you are.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Make your teeth yella --
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
More like thirty.
...Who'd ya fight?
'Bout an hour ago.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Really think so?
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
How am I doin'?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya always in a bad mood --
What kinda business?
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
What's ya sister like to do?
Why?
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
...I can't haul meat no more.
I'll tear his head off.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
They must've taken it off me.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
So altruistic.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What the hell is that?
When will I hear from you?
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
How do you know that?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Keep reading...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Good heart, at what?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
By the hour of nine.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
That dreamers often lie.
I will follow you.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Do you have it?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
I don't know.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Not to me, you know that.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Who are you?  IRA?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
That fucking figures...
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Gregor, is that you?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
He's tough, your American friend.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
You should watch what you eat.
Where is this broad?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
How did you know?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
I borrowed that, too...
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Alright, it's done.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
It is at that.
What the fuck happened?
Give me a cigarette.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
You have to stop doing that!
And now...
Gaelic.
Doing well.  This is?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
That's not what I mean.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
How long is it going to take?!
It's gonna be o.k.
Do you have everything?
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
How are ya?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Yeah?  So?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Why?
I don't know.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Damn it’s hot in here...
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
What's this?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
It was going to be a surprise!
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
This isn't right...
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Invitation, please.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You bring American money?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Carter, get off that stage!
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You lied to me.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Slow down, baby.
I don't want to hear this.
I don't understand?
Wait!  There's people down there!
Get it out of here!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
She saved our lives.
Yes.  We have heaven.
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Very nice.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
You move well.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
I didn't know which side you were on.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Feds asked for me?
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You talk very fast.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
You make the plate?
The license!  You get it?!
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
That's not how it goes.
Want some?
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
I could get promoted right out of here.
Jesus...what do you want?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Johnson...
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I do.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Got any last minute advice?
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
"Nothing but net."
Fisher, let him talk.
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Look, he's running after her.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Okay, we'll order out.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I think you'd look good in red.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Your two cinnamon rolls.
They made me put my hat back on.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
Really?
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
Too much.
Maybe someday.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
No.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Kind of isolated.
Where did you disappear to?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
But I'm weird.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
You take the microwave?
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Even when you were young?
It's delicious, trust me.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Walter.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You should write something about this.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Hello.
Did you talk to him?
What?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
Why not?
Where's your mom?
No.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
It's Y. O. H.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Eighty dollars.
What?!
No, I'm not, but --
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Great.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Dad!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Everyone at work heard you.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
God, she's beautiful.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Do you like baseball?
What about camping?
Do you like it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
It's a little derivative.
Hi.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Is he there?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Got any more ideas?
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Who? A scab?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sick, Mama?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Forget it.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
No. New York.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What?
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
I can't.
I can't leave.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
We been through that.
He knows where I work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
Oh shit
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
Danny?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
No one ever noticed?
You don't trust me?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
Shoot him.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
Cool it. We got business.
No last name?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Danny?
This the guy?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
Excuse me?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
Report.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
Last I knew.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
He ain't Wade.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Watching.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Not yet.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Glad of it.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
What about the company?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
You get a translator, Captain?
Uh, Captain...
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
What do you think?
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Yes, Private.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
I usually like surprises.
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
How do you do it?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Gee, it's easy.
Then what's love?
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Yes.
No, you're not a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
What are you doing?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Did he ever get rough with you?
Do you love him?
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
That's right, work it out.
Mom, please?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Are you busy on Friday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
I'll go.
What are these?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Nice one.
I think you should wear that.
Won't you see me later?
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Yes.
It's okay, everybody does that.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Well, I need to study, and...
It sounded like you did.
Is this because of your dad?
Did you talk to Corey?
You told your dad?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Yeah.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Now you're back.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
Well, let's find him.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Where are the guards?
What do I got for you?
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
What are you doing?
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
I was just the accountant.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Better this month than last?
Don't ever do that to me again.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
They arrived.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
I can do it, Captain.
Can't we hold him?
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
He's broken his pattern.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Shit.
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
What if I said goodbye?
It helped me realize one thing.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
And are the police sure about that?
What are you going to do?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Why?
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You’re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Dewey?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
What do you mean?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
What about rehearsal?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
She's not here right now.
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Jesus.  Hello?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?!
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Please, call me Gale.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Jesus Gale what happened?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Are you sure?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Where's Gale?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Are you saying she was-
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
What'd he say?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
You're not happy with your part.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Who's this?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Hello?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
I thought she was dead.
You rode your bike out there?
My dad's in the other room.
No...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
You heard me.
Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
NO! Don't believe him.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Hello.
Just some scary movie.
I don't know.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
I have to go now.
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
I wanna play a game.
What kind of game?
No... please.
Don't do this. I can't...
No...
Michael... Michael Myers.
But you're doing so well.
You tricked me...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
At the airport.
She's tough.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
I'll look for it.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
...so call if you need me.
Stu was with me last night.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
She's saving herself for you.
What's Leatherface doing here?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Do you believe this shit?
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Come on, Sid.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
TATUM!
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
What do you think?
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
How you feeling?
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
You didn't know.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
Here he comes.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
You just met me.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
There's a bucket here.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
He must have left another puzzle piece.
No witnesses of any kind?
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
He just may be nuts enough.
I wish I still thought like you.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Well, that was money well spent.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
What are you talking about?
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Stay with him.
Put your gun down!!
It smells good.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
But Mose Harper said...
Let's get along...
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You all right, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What in...?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Unnt-meah!
How'd you come by this?
That's what I said.
Keep talking.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
You want us to fire a shot if...
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Hey! What's the idea...?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Why it's just a snip of calico...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Martin, it's not funny!
Martin, what-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Ellen.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
No, I've never seen him before.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Well, look here!
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Oh
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
So now you are free to love
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
There's never any
Where is the play?
God be praised!  Locked?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Romeo.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
How will it?
Another little problem.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"But new struck nine."
Two hours at prayer!
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Your mother, and your father
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Your Majesty!
"I know not."
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Master Shakespeare
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
My lady!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Oh but why "alas?"
Then I will go with you.
Will! What--?
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Will you read it for me?
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
My lady VIOLA.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
She loves me, Thomas!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
Alex, I don't have the time --
He's still here.
When are you going to let the police know?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
No, not that.
Don't you worry about that.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Is this being recorded?
Well, is it?
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
What?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
Who was it?
I'm not usually drunk.
Now?
I wonder how he did it?
What are you doing?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Who's going to do it?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Stop nagging.
Love and happiness for ever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
What's he doing here?
Hello. Hello.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
We have to talk.
You'll wait in the hall?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Are you all right?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
You mustn't take it so badly.
So, uh...
Downstairs.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes.
Why do you want a room here?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Do you know many of these people?
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Eh, I don't know.
Hello.
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Would you like to come in?
What's it about?
I see.
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
I write about it?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
No. I haven't seen them.
Yes.
I suppose so.
Sorry?
You're in a good mood today, George.
What?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
George --
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
What're you doing later?
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
You know what I'm talking about.
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Chopped liver?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Yeah, it is.
You are.
How is she?
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
George!
You're late, George.
You do it.
Jill's coming with us.
... I don't get it done often.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
And?
Did you?
Baby...
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Don't do it.
-- don't you want to --
I don't know what gets into me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
What are you looking at?
-- ass and legs --
Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do-
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
I'm busy, man.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yes, George.
I have to see you.
Hi, George.
Call me!
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Now, George --
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're different.
Honey?
Yeah.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
George.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah.
George.
I already said hello.
When is that?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I know, honey.
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
Well that's something.
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
That was him.
What do you wanna know for?
Stop it.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
This really ought to be layered...
You live like a pig.
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Did they have something against me?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
What about Jackie?

Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Of course not.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Hi, Leonard.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Well, he is.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
He does?
What?
C'mon.
Why don't you ask for another one?
Johnny!
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
George? Was he alone?
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
-- why?
You're going?
What's wrong?
Thank you.
Are you married?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Dad?
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Yes.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Yeah.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Jack...
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
It's so pretty.
Danny?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
How did he manage to do that?
It's okay, really.
Sure.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
No, we don't mind.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.
And you didn't see anything at all?
He's still asleep.
Of course I am.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me!
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
I'd better collect my family first.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
What if I say no?
LET THY SPIRIT
How are you doing.
What?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
No... it's fine.
Thanks.  A lot.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Hurry, Sister!
What?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
It'll be hell.
Hopeless I
Come on, we're late.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
You have to help me
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Mary Clarence!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
St. Anne's?
I see.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
No!  No!  I can't do this!
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
And if I don't?
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Like what?
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Where's who?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
There she is!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
You didn't shoot!
What's she doing?
It should be here any minute.
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
An... entertainer?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
If we could speak alone.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
You need to sleep.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
The Widow Windsor.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
What good is this?
Did your father take a loan?
This is farewell.
What now?
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Blood.
My God... what has happened?
What is so urgent?
I have not been able to face him yet.
The church.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Can you help?
All right then.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Thank ye.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
You got that shit right.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
Don't hit that boy no more.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Don't you live somewhere?
How come?
Were they bad people?
Maybe they needed it.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Oh, jackin' off?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
It was still alive when you buried it?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Yeah.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
Yeah, I guess.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Well, okay. I got you some.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
What brings you back?
I done et just a little bit ago.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Let's just go, Marsha.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Like me, too.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Not an easy book.
And what about for you?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
What do you mean?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
I'm all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
She looks just like you.
Still, you can't just write her off.
No you're not.
What's this?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A little. Not much.
Open it.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I figured he had a right to know.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
And have you mended them?
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Of course. Where else?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I didn't expect to see you again.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Three nights.
Two or three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
And?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
No wonder he was angry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hi, kid.
How do you want that cooked?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
None.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
Did you write that column?
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
Well, what then, sergeant?
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
You said three minutes.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
You think so?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
We don't let go, you s...
What for, Sheriff?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
White or black?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Improved...how?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Upsy-daisy.
Okay. 
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
But suppose he loses?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
With me?
You going to call the police?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
What are you doing?
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
What happened?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
Blow where?
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Oh, he does!
With ME?
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
I'll say there is!
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Joe -
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
She sings, too.
Oh - Sugar!
I'm not crowding you, am I?
You all right?
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Yeah - Josephine.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
What for?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
You're leading again.
I don't care.
I forgive you.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I don't like no witnesses.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got it second-hand.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Me?
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
You know - I play tenor sax.
You don't say?
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
I want mine to wear glasses.
What's happened?
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your face is familiar.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Yeah.  Real hot.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Shell Oil?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Josephine.
The most wonderful thing happened -
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
Three?
Love it.  Which way?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean - like frigid?
I don't want to bore you.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Anything this time?
Well - ?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
You shave with your spats on?
Refresh my memory.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know what I love about all this?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
I should get going.
Does Kat know?
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Seeing you again....
Hey, Kat.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
You shit!
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
You didn’t have to do that.
Like fifteen.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
And so you did your job, right?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Yes, sir...
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Well, looka here...
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Goodnight, Daddy...
From Miss Johnson --
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
What's your daddy's name?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
You got two shirts on?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Who is they?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Good night, Mama...
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Is he gon' be gone long?
Whatcha wanta order?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rmph rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
The N word?
What's going on, Chef?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
May I?
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's the password?
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
What's a butfor?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
That was sweet!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Stan!
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I'm needing lunch.
The F word?!
But I-
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
It's from your mother.
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Who's my cream puff?
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
You don't have watches?
Got it.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Oh, thank you.
Well I appreciate that.
So...
Where the hell did you come from?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Why, didn't they say?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
We're going to die.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
So you were looking for a new challenge.
What are we going to do?
We don't.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I can't let you do that.
Yeah.  We did it.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
But how are you going to escape?
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Sooner than later.
What do you mean?  What happened!
No, just enjoying the view.
What is happening around here!!!
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Heh, heh, heh.
Sorry about your loss.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You know, Elvis bowled.
Sure, Sid.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
100 years! 
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What the fuck is this?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
It depends.
Who's there!
Junior.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Like this?
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I'm a bowler.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
This is a vicious cycle.
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Do you talk with your mom?
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I can't tell you, Theo.
You should.
Can I come with you?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Sez you!
Very professional.
Lips still for sale?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Fletcher, get away from there...
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Fifty yards and closing.
Thirty yards.
Where is it?
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Maybe older --
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
But sir --
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
You don't think weapons are important?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Going active.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
It's chipped.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Look at this.
We had considered it.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Because when we get down there --
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
You're next, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
What?  Why...
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Norman.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
In Edmunds' things.
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Parasolutrine?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
You're insane.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Don't, Beth.
Stop it!
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
What?
When did it come across?
You holding up alright?
You sound defensive.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
You remember opening the door?
Norman?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
... you there?  Norman?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
How's that working out, by the way?
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Norman Johnson.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
You've heard of me?
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
You want me to try?
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
No, not anymore.
I'll get the information.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
They use the Bogan Force.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
You're Starkiller?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
I think she's going to be all right.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Please continue, Sergeant.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
You're late.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Which way ?
Where'd it come from ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Uh, look, Diz...
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Cover me.
What's that, Diz ?
Way to go, amigo !
Good good, then it's all settled.
...CUT OFF !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
On whose authority, Corporal ?
Let's go.
Don't be a hero...
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
They have repressed the Creator.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
What does that mean?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
Programming ready?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Granted.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Hello, Ilia.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
I still contain fragments of my human half.
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
They had a pattern to follow...
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Then you'll be wet.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I have one, but they lost it.
You haven't heard of it.
You like my play.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
But why the dalmation?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
...lost the screw...
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Hi.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
...yes.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...and we could get up every morning...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
What is it all about?
What am I gonna do?
But it'll stop the movie.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
I'm sorry.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
They're holding it for ransom.
...why am I here...?
It's Marty on the Coast -
How big is this horse?
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
No, you're absolutely r...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Izzat so?
What's his name?
You have no right to...
Look.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
...I can't do it, Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
And you know what...?
That's cor...
-- she's got 'religion.'
What?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
I have to talk to you.
...he's the producer of the movie.
What's in the case?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
He saw the girl in the car...
Town's out of lilacs.
I'm very sorry I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
We're out of money.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
What's the...
You can't write it?
How do they know that, you told them?
How do you know you saw it?
I...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
...not at all...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
Zat true?
Where are we?
Why?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
That happens.  To families.
Wow.  Who's that for?
And don't tell her I told you.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
And what do you do wh...
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
She still packing for her trip?
You think this is funny?
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
In high school.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
No.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Poof!  You're happy now.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Mommy?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
That I do.  Always will.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You say that like I don't know that.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
Because you don't really seem here.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
We...
It's temporary.
What did you do?
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
...in.
I have a snoop.
I need practice.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
Look, you've never liked me...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
She hasn't mentioned this.
It's the same choice you made.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
Why didn't I?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
They're my kids.
No problem.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Restless.
Where you goin'?
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Don't ever say that.
You know...Stanley...
Nice to have you here.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Speak English.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Why was he on Death Row?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
It's all about who you know.
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Ready for tomorrow?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Nigger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Anything I might know about?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
I do.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Scooby?
What for?
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I'll lead.
Forget about it.
What do you mean?
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Enjoying the tour so far?
Go fuck yourself...
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Are we adrift--
Get your men to do it!
Can I have a glass of water?
Possibly some coffee?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
What are you talking about, Major?
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Does the threat board show anything?
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Yes, sir.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Who do you think you're talking to?
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
Suppose that were the case?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I'm trying to, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Do you think we'd cheat?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
How long will it take to receive them all?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Roger, maintain.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Then this is it.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Roger.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
No, this looks like the real thing.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Where'd they get you?
What's your point, Lothar?
Release first safety.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
I said that's the point!
Sure, King.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
In Group?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Don't let 'em fight.
Jesus Christ.
A long, long, long...
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Good.
What?
Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Am I fucking him?
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
He paid you man.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
It's okay.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
No, but I heard it was great.
Yeah, we're all above that.
What's up guys?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hi.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
What? What'd you do?
They let you out?
I don't know.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Your completely missing the point.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
This is ridiculous!
Oh, yeah?
What feelings?
Come with me.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, I don't.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Oh, yeah?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You're unbelievable.
Good, man.
Sorry.
For a while.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
Look, get down off my property.
Yeah?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Alright, alright already.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Me?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
What are you going to do? Hm?
So where are you?
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
Fuck.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Diane?  Diane!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
I'm sorry.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Ammo?
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
Is that you down there?
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
They could kill you.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I had a teacher like that once.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
Check.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's Norma?
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
What happened?
Her own movie theatre.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
We've missed you too, dear.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Who else ?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Cut away from me?
They've come for my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
How about some evening clothes?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
The other guests?
What are the notes?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Go away.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I made your bed this afternoon.
Is that so!
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Got a title?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
I don't feel like it right now.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
This is my favourite place in the city.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Let's talk about us, not her.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
We're from different worlds.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
That makes it worse.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
She's right. They'll string her up.
A little.
I know it.
Why should I believe you?
Hey, where you going?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Yes.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
There isn't any.
Your hair looks the same.
Don't you believe in knocking?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You're wasting your breath.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
It's lovely. . .
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
There is a way.
You're going to take me back?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
You...um...you never got married?
I just can't stand this.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Turn on the T.V.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Is this blackmail?
Can you do that?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Who's the other woman?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
How would you know?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
So?
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Yes! This time we got it right!
Hostages?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Who ????
I was right. you are Superman.
Let's go to my place.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
What else could I do?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Genius!  --  Lex.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
DELETE IN CUTTING
Shhhhhhh!
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
He flies as well, then . . .
You must be freezing.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Who is this . . . Superman?
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Free!
Look, they need a machine to fly.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Oh . . . my . . .
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Yes, darling?
What's he going to say?
What's that?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
We'll all fry.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
I'll deal with you later.
I know, but  --
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where you're headed?
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Big night coming up?
I'm telling you, I was there.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
You're just jealous.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Oh.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
So I've noticed.
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
Damn!  This will get him.
Krypton!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Don't let me down.
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Boy!
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I guess I got carried away
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Superman???
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
How old are you?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
There.
I gave him steady employment --
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Ally.  That's right.
And what does he do again?
Then...when did she get better?
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Are you sure?
It just seems...kind of weird.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
So what brings you out tonight?
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Yes.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
That's right.
Anything you didn't understand?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
What happened to summer?
And winter?
So do you like your new room?
Nicole!
Nicole?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Should I keep reading?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Why?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's the local bar?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
How old is she?
Is this it?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
No.
I was scared.
Why not?
You remember this?
What's so funny?
Do you like the colour?
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yes.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I know Steve.  No.
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Yeah!
But...
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
You ought to be used to me by now.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Did you now?  On which bounce?
I didn't do anything!
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?
What does that mean?
Radical.
Can I stop by my house?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Swear.
Everything.
Affirmative.
Not even of dying?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No!
It must end here... or I am the future.
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
We're better off by ourselves.
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
The CPU from the first terminator.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
Where do you stand on all this?
And no elbows on the table!
I guess you admire musicians.
So, what does the Russki want?
So what is it?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Steve.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
I'm sorry.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Sure.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Yes, you remember.
Show me.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
What do you think?
I'm sure.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
Not possible.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl.  You know.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Give me the short version.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Call her.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You don't talk to me like that.
Clean out your locker.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
You deserted me.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Where are we going?
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
What are you doing here?
What is it?
Take the picture out.
What are you doing... ?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
All I mean is... someone like you...
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
It's mine...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Nicholas...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
I have to get to the airport...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
No.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Will you?
Do it for YOU.
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Split it?
Yes.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
May I make two suggestions... ?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Thank you.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
What gentleman, Maria?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Just what I told you.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Hey!  I heard screaming...
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Was sure she'd be in here.
It's still an electric shock!
Are you working with her?
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
All the carvings.
Welcome Home.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
You know what he's really upset about?
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
Get a blanket!
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Why?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
What do you do?
No.
Jeez.
Good night, Theo.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
Is it over?
Are you sure?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
As soon as you get dressed.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
Italian.
What's the matter?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What.
You think I'm staying?
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Edward Rama?
I didn't expect anyone.
Who done it, then?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Huh?
What?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Same.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Didn't get it.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What's that, like a P.O. box.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I see.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't seem bothered.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Where's Big Sur?
How far?
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
So what's your beef, pal?
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Don't you work with Ian?
You sure?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Been away a lot.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Which kind?
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
What?
How'd you get in here.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
So why would he want to see you.
You know her?
Hello there.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Thanks.  You, too.
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Mr Crane.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
...No, please.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Sure.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
She's a rare one.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
...You know... who *who* is?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Please, Ed.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
OK, how did you know?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
No thanks.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
...You sure, Eddie?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Mr...?
...I'm Crane.
Doesn't bother me.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Someone broke into this room.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What happened?!
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
What's going on?
What's that?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock?
How many storage areas are there?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Jesus, what is this?
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
What?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
What kind of egg is it?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
Genetic damage?
What is it doing?
Help someone!
Where exactly?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Where have you been?
Every time you and Marlon--
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
--we need more charcoal.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, that was our house!
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
Is there any way around?
They're coming.  Any minute.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Do you live around here?
Well, we're FBI agents.
What is it you find incredible?
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Yes.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
You follow me out here for a reason?
Who sent you?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Negotiating with whom?
How can I reach you?
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Scully...
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
This virus -- it... 
What do you think it is?
Where'd they go?
Scully --
Cold...
I can't go any farther.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
Agent Mulder --
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A virus?
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Sing a song of sixpence...
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
I do it all the time!
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Don't bring it home in this.
...a pocketful of rye.
Damn him.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
What then?
Agent Novak?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Why'd you bring him here?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Thank you.
Oh no... No you don't.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
She changed the codes.
When did he lapse into the coma?
What about the legalities of this...?
Agent Novak.
What about the cat?
So?
I need it.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
You were awfully good.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
I don't know. They didn't answer.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
H-E-Z-T...
When...what did you do?
Seemed like a good idea.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Have you seen Calloway?
He liked to laugh.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
They are - private - letters.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Get the next plane.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
So would I.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
It wouldn't work.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Seems exciting.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...this way.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
Baron Kurtz.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Kurtz.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Yes, it is.
...Mr. Martins?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
You think?! Based on what?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Too difficult?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Why no silencer?
Where'd you get this?
I want to learn to read it.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
It looks a little like a swastika.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
No. What are you looking for?
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
That's a much easier game.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
And? WHat did you notice?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Those aren't Jews.
Who? How would I know him?
I always won.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
I don't do that.
Don't tell me what I --
What part of Germany are you people from?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
What about chicken?
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Tell it to Hitler.
Isn't it true?
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
What is it?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Not too fast.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
When do you want it to go off?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Are you an artist?
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
How did you know they were Jews?
You can't say that....
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Do you think I...
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Oh, fuck you...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Does he know?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Did the driver really freeze?
It can't be true!
The Italian, I presume?
Where did you two meet?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Well, good night, then...
Jacques!  Johana!
What else is there?
Ten thousand.
Enzo, wake up!
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
And where did you say you were from?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
You're the best, Enzo!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Enzo?
What?
Can I come in?
Anybody can have a bad day!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
Don't you have a heater?
I recognize you.
But what brought you to Sicily?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
You look adorable.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
How are you?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Promise me one thing.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Why don't you ask me?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
How was your trip?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Wait!  Professor...?
There won't be any need for that sir.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Mordechai?
Esther!
Mom! We're eating!
Anything else?
What's wrong with him?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Is he in love with you?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Sure!
I'm sick.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's about the leopard.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
To the eye? Like other men.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
What are you getting at?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
No —- not yet.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Who is he?
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Are we understood?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Are you all right?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
How... When did you...
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
I don’t.
Is there anything to understand?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Where is that?
To get me killed...?
What do you suggest?
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
The word for those things is croissants.
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
By your Austrian?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
What...?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
We’ve still got the Italian...
How much of a hurry are you in?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who’s the money man?
Where?
Where are we?
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
May I...?
Must I speak to you in French?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
The £1,000 is on account.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
Clients come and go.
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
What is it?
Five to three. You’re early.
Evening. Table for one?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
He just said he had good reasons.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Welcome to the club.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Gluck.
So why didn’t he?
Mossad?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Who do they think I am?!
The king said you're his finest archer...?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
I'm already free...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
We have to press home the attack!
But that was her order!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Were you baptized?
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
Is it long and hanging down?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What's going on?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
You don't believe me anymore?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
What have you done to me?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
My... visions...
They won't come anyway.
No.  That was a sword in a field.
But you already confessed this morning...
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I'm going to get a doctor.
Really?
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota!
Sit.
How long have you been married?
When's your baby due?
Let me see this.
Funny time to say this.
wish I knew you better.
Henryk's in there.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help us?
We're recruiting.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Boys, boys...
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Otherwise what?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
What's happening?
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
She looks tired.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
You don't want to learn.
Everyone has to practice.
What does she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
And when is the next lesson?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Mama.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Which way are the rooms?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Twist, you know this guy?
How much did ya lose?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Lonnegan after you, too?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You just worry about your end, kid.
Everything go all right?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
I'm not sure I know it.
Raise 500.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
I guess I left it in my room.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
You got a back door to this place?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What is this?  I got work to do.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
What about this Rosebreen?
Why not?
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
Any luck?
Why did that man want to kill him?
I can't.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
What is it?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Not that scrawny little....? 
How did you ever remember me?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Your father?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Where did you get this gun?
He'll still be your son-in-law!
This is my wedding.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Not at all.
That woman!
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
What about the suicide?
No proof?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Get anything?
I said he hadn't written me.
Well....
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
About three.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Good morning --
But he's interested!
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I'll get some.
Why, you said...
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Well, let me do that for you.
I see.  I see.
My wife.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
By the way, how is your father's side?
How many drinks have you had?
Isn't that my drink?
What are you going to do with it?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I never saw that before.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You dog!
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
What do you mean?
How long has he been dead?
I'm going to tell her.
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Why are you saying it?
Nick Charles here?
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
What are you doing.
What kind of mine?
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
What about it?
You're the one with all the ideas.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
You're out of your mind.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
At-at-at-at-at.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
They're not going to--
She okay?
You didn't step on any mine.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
This.  Whatever it is.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're going to kill us!
If they land--
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Must be a compartment.
Wait.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Getting cold.
What do you figure it is?
And then shoot them.
To where?
...Wes...?
Which way do we go!?
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Australia.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Iraqis.
I thought we were dead.
How long we going to keep this up.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
What do you think?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Stress category.
Control ON.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Are you all right?
THX!
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
What's going on....what are you doing?
Who?  Who's leaving?
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
Well?
You're in violation.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'm leaving.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
You don't know that!
Yes.
And you are...?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Alright, let's check it out.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
So cut both.
Which one's which?
Fuck factor?
Good, now the other side.
Something round, two wires ...
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Bev, you're the greatest...
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
C4, plastic explosive.
Glass, what is it?
Then why tell me?
What is that?
Who are you calling, sis?
I want to work this.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Prints?
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
You okay?
T.J., what're you doing?
I'll do it.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
No!
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
What did you talk about?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
No!
Good morning, Major.
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
The tennis player?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Thank you!
Please.
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Filiba ...
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Now, Lily--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Yes...?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
What shade of powder do you use?
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
Eighteenth century.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Yes, madame?
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Yes, I would!
Mariette!
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
You're certain?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
There's a satellite call for you.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
She's not on the starboard side either.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
But I was with him the whole time.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
And these were drawn from life?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
May I cut in, miss?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Now it's worse.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I'm not going without you.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
Never let go.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
Anya!
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Good afternoon--
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Will you pardon me?
What did you want a gun for?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
Aces full.
There's soft music--
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Married?
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Yes?
Sooner it you like.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
What, again?
What?--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
Not a chance.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Thank you, sir. 
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
I'm going to the show--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
How about you?
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Here's your fifty.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Where do you live?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Yes.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
With your dry wit and humor--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Congratulations.
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
That's the truth--every single word!
I'm all right.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
He said to turn loose of him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
I want them spitting blood!
Come on, you...
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
On three?  You call it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
What's wrong, Doc?
Very cosmopolitan.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
A which?
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Doesn't suit you.
And I don't even know your full name.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Wyatt!  My God...
Oh, all right.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
There they are.  No herd though.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
It's that woman from the coach!
Get down, boy.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
We should get moving.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
Virgil?
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
...And what's that, my dear?
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Q! How are you?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
His newspapers?
Natalya?
Sidney Winch, meet -
Where to now, Jimbo?
They point, I shoot.
... Kids?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
No?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Blood or Dutch?
What the hell does that do?
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And number two?
And when might that be?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
No.
You won't get away with this!
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
He brought that up from the wreck.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Please sir. Please -
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
You okay?
I'm going back home with Harry.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Since this morning.
What did you put on it?
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
Wow!  Cool!
Yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
To infinity and beyond!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Woody!  Buzz!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
We're almost there.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
According to my nava-computer, the --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
I dunno.
A lunchbox?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Reach for the sky!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
Everything is gone, now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I'm Melanie.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Helena --
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
I think she's lying.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
My Leica's gone.
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Are you going to?
How's David?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
In school?
What's that mean?
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do we do?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
You will help me with my other problem.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
What's your name?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
Who do we interface with on their side?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, I've not brought them.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Great.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
I don't see why not.
Holding hands?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
No.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So, what's he like?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Now remember --
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You don't know, do you?
I don't rate that at all.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
But you don't have the money?
The Sick Boy method.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
There.
It's fresh air.
How's it going with Gail?
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
A walk.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
But the shuttle-
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
But how?
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
I do not often think of the past.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
There, you see? See?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
How do you know?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
I am here, Captain.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
I must have your starship.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?


Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
What for?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
Who is your User, program?
Flynn!!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
What about our friend - Sark?
A User -- in our world?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Watch it!
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Yes, MCP.
Yori... hey...
How?
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Can you cover me for an hour?
That's not true, honey--
Dana, are you listening to me?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
Son of a bitch!
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
She's lying.
Now what?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
Any minute now.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm late.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Why did you continue to see him?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
I can do it!
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
Is it working yet?
No.  But I wanted to.
What is it?
Do you still love me?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Yeeaoowww!!
Who's your little friend?
What's going on, Harry?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Tell me what happened?
To our assignment.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Ask me them again. One by one.
What are your turn-ons?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Do you get paid a lot?
She OD'd, didn't she?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Who and what is a Drexl?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
Wannabee nigger...
You comin' to L.A.? When?
I'm a married man.
Money problems?
You're really in love, aren't you?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Clarence.
In case of what?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Leave the gorillas.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. Not yet.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I can, but I don't.
I really don't know.
What makes you think I could do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
Come again?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Where'd he come from?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Suspect's words -
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
He knows.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
How do you know? You been there?
No.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
It's important to observe everything.
A jail?  Prison?
You're afraid of germs?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Mason???
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
You smell so good.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
The gun! ... I lost it
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't understand what we're doing.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Jo...Jose????
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Uh, that message...me?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It's nonsense.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Will he be back soon?
But he's dead.
Hey.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
No!
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
Yes, I have.
You're not from around here, are you?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Beautiful?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
How far is it to California?
Take me with you.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
Lied?  What do you mean?
John, please--
Shit!
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Grace . . . Grace?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
He was going to take the money.
Well, nothing.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Are you all right?
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Someone will find me.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Hungry?
Now what can I do for you?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
Drop it, Jake.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Yeah, well, me too.
I came for Grace.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I asked you a question.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
What happened to your hand?
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
More or less.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Who the hell is this!?
What the fuck do you want?
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
What can I do for you, lad?
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Got any requests?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
But you was going to fight for me.
You Harlin?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Twenty-after-ten.
Nothing.
What the hell happened to my car?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Yeah, but it was shot.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Soda.  You got any soda?
That's right on my way.
I like that about me, beautiful.
I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You love him?
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You mean the Shaman?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
The old lady?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Megan?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
You've never been sick?
I assumed because of the train.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
It's for last week's game.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I thought he was carrying something.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
I'm going to go in.
Why'd you do that?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I'll just shoot him once.
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Yeah, hello.
Was your family traveling with you?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
Twelve years.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You told them cowboys you had it.
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
He give 'em names?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Yeah. See?
Yeah, I guess.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Uh... a little, maybe.
They really got all that money, them whores?
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
But... if he doesn't miss?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
A sign on him?
Then... what?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
N-no, sir?
William Munny, yeah.
He said that, huh?
Been gone near three years now.
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Shit!
They takin' water?
Yeah, he's in there.
Say, Bill...
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Fuck you.
Say, Ned... ?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Who ?
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
This is not right.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Why don't you just calm down'
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You watch your mouth.
No killing?
How are you, Keaton?
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
When does he post bail?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
I don't know about that.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
Then what?
What call?
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
This is all bullshit.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Objection, we've...
How old are you?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Pardon?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
And it's over...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Joe...  Joe...
Dr. Gruber.
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
...he's a good man...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Are you with me...are you awake...?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
... I know.  I went ...
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
I just saw her.
Hi.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
A single hour.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Would you like a drink now?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No.
Yes.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Hello.
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Judy Barton.
Just dinner.
Thank you again. Good-night.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
But I like that one, Scottie.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
You want me to dress like her?
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
Can't you see?
Scottie, why are we here?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I made it.
What are you going to do?
Why am I here? What happened?
Do you remember where you were?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
-- talking to you...
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
No.
Why?
Where?
How do you know?
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Where's your husband?
Go on.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
No... we're together...
Where?
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
I know. Everybody tells me.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Well?
Could be.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Is she pretty?
Yeah.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
Jesus.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
What's that?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Don't point at me.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Stop it!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
We have to get going.
Don't snap at them!
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Real times.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
I want you to hear me out.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Have you thought about what I said?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
She's in there!
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
What?
What?
Take care of business.
Okay fine.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
There's my point exactly.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Are we supposed to?
This is ridiculous.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
What do you mean, you think so?
Florist?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Seating problems.
Keith do not trivialize this.
I need your help.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Yeah. Nesting.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah. Sure.
You killed a prostitute.
He kept saying he was protected.
I'll take a ride.
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
You alright?
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Good times.
Right.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Stop this, stop this.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Don Amalio!
Take me there.
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
How did you know about that?
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
You're lying.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
So, Ramona!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
You see how much you like her?
Kill him.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Miss Viridiana ...
Well... is it so urgent?
Yes. Why?
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Don't say that.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Don't talk like that!
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
You all right?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty—four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
This better not be a wild goose chase.
What the hell happened?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
HEY!!!
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What happened when he was 17?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
I am impressed.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Don't get out of the car.
You know I am.
What's the problem?
Real effective security...
Which way?
How did you find out about the toxin?
You're not capable of it.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
See something?
Nice work.
You okay?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....
What if he's busy tonight?
What are you saying...
What about it?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
No, this is great.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
What can it hurt.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
Mr. President, this is St...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
When do we bring'em back?
What crisis?
It won't hold.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
What would do that...?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
...but...
...they sound what?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...can we see the Kitten...?
Yes.  That's true.  But...
No rain.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
...where is my pill?
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
We're locked into Albania.
Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...?
Whaddaya think?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
It can be documented that he displayed the...
Is there a press conference today?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
W...what?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
The Albanian Campaign.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Show Must Go On.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Don't tune it too good.
I go with this here... 
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
I have the White House on the Line.
Public Domain.
I didn't ask for a dog.
You like it?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Why a beret?
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
A wider option of what?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Oh, hell...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Grand Marnier.
... That's what you told us to say.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
What the hell...
What's going on?
Speak English will ya.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your words, not mine...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Yeah, right...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
So what firm you with, pal?
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
Know the name?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
What the hell do you want?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Where is it?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I don't.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Do you think you're ready?
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
Your books Master Loftmore
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
Well?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I started seeing things.
Who's idea was it?
Your friend saw them.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
Who?
Hello?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
I wanted to apologize.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
Love.
Mrs. Frank?
No, I don't.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
What was her major?
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Seance.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Oh...
Are you okay?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
What?
Then what was it?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Okay.  Okay.
Adamant?
I'm a terrible friend.
I don't know.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
She's awake.
It's today?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
If you have to work...
It's okay if you're not.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Maybe we should just...
Claire...
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Yep.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
Do I have everything?
What?
I may have seen her on campus.
I take it your not mad at me.
"You know..."
Claire...
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Who is this...?
Who is this...?
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Michael...  Do what you can.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
To love, you must be able to feel.
I know that you're evil.
Only you...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
Harder...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
HARDER!
you're very --- different.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Why don't you let at do that...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Stop it.
Seems more like a year than a month.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
You know...?
Ro, how long have we known each other.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Wanna snack...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You alright...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I can't.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Wow...
You okay...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
He's got great hands.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
I heard something like that
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
All the time?
Do you take sugar?
What are you doing?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Sugar?
I don't know
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Tell me about your wife...
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
Where are you going?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Well, what do you think?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
It's been what, three years?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
ANGEL...
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
See? Did you see that?
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
I thought I loved her.
Get them together.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Sweetheart, what is it?
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You're way ahead of me again?
The lesson being?
You guys are my parents.
Whatever helps you cope.
Sorry I--
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
The one with the horses.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Well?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Can you believe that was me?
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
If you could just sign right there.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Great.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
Me?
I don't get the distinction.
Don't write that part.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
I mean my father.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Tell me more.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
You were the new and improved you.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
My father must've been amazing.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
Bad news.
My parents? What do you mean?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
That bothers you?
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Oh, Ray... no...
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
A ride.  You want one?
I say something funny?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
He... Sam Lombardo?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Don't forget the car wash.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
But check this...
There's nothing for them to get.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Where is she?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Get away from me.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Sandy... What's up?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Always hoping.  Or this...
Aha!
That's a lot of butler.
You feeling all right?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Well... that, too.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
I know!  I know!
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You've... done... this... before.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
French?
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Well?
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I can't.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Then you get us out of here.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You all right?
You!!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She's in love.
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
What's the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
She needs to be changed.
Madmartigan.
She's hungry.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Milking?
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
How reliable is this kid?
What have you got?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Just us.
What's your first move?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Where are you taking us?
Now what's the problem?
Where are you taking us now?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long?
Your husband's?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
You know carpentry?
When will you be going?
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Anybody know about this?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Who was that man?
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
What about Carter?
Is this where we're going?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
Dorothy!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
If she?
...have you come back?
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Ahh!  Ah!
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
That's right.  What's she doing?
...paper?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh - I'll get it!
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
...free!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Um-hmm.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
What happened?
Up!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Not even a rhinoceros?
Mr. Gale!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
No, sir!
To Oz?
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Hey, Dorothy!
It's a whozis.
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about us?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well --
What the hell are you talking about?
Who’s she?
Nuclear.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
He’s sealed himself in.
Do you know what you’re doing?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
I met you at my father’s funeral.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Who is he?
How long has he been with you?
Then take me with you.
Vodka martini.
How did you survive?
What are you talking about?
...what?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
Where’s M?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
I’ll send someone out.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
What about our end?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Blake?  Dead?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Jon, where are we?
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I¹m not.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Laurie --
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
So do I.  So do you.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
No comment.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
Adrian.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
New information.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
What is this place?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
Not bad for a gimp.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Is that all?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Like what?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Where are you going?
Who are you?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
Are you alright?
Where are we going?
You okay?
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
What...?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's so damn funny?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
What's this?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
Scott.. I -
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
Anything else I can get you?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
What do you say?
Logan, do you see this ring?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I do love a good check mate.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The point of what?
I lost him.
Is it enough?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Yes, sir.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
You have your tickets?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
I suppose you're right.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
You mean... the laboratory??
There seem to be quite a few books.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Vermicelli.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
But what you were doing?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Throw the second switch!
You can't win 'em all.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
But you did -- I just heard it.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
What monster?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
How's everything?
What's that tune that you're playing
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Good night, Doctor.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
Look how far we've come.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Do you have a reservation?
Foooooood!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
